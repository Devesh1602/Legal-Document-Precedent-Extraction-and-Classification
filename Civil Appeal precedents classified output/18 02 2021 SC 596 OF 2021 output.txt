Precedent Referred : 2. Appeal preferred by Lalitha R Nath and 24 others impugns the final order and judgment dated 29th May, 2020 of the Division Bench of the Kerala High Court, partially allowing Writ Petition (Civil) No. 10205 of 2020 filed by Kannur Medical College (hereinafter referred to as 'KMC' or 'the College') by staying operation of the order dated 29th April, 2020 passed by the Kerala University of Health Sciences (in short, 'KUHS') whereby the College was denied affiliation for conducting MBBS and post graduate courses for the academic year 2020-21. The stay, as granted, is subject to the College satisfying the following conditions: (i) furnishing of bank guarantee of Rs. 10 crores before the Registrar of the Kerala High Court; and (ii) depositing of the title deed of 25 acres of land situated at Sy. No. 13/1 in Village Anjarakkandi, as security for payment of any amount that the College may be liable to pay as per directions to be issued in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 15337 of 2019, titled The Principal v. The Admission and Fee Regulatory Committee.

Precedent Relied : 6.2 On 28th April, 2016, in Sankalp Charitable Trust and Another v. Union of India and Others, (2016) 7 SCC 487 this Court had directed that admissions to MBBS courses shall be conducted through National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET).

Precedent Referred : 6.3 On 9th August, 2016, the Union Government had directed all States and Union Territories to conduct combined/centralised counselling for 2016-17 MBBS admissions, consistent with the judgment of this Court in Modern Dental College and Research Centre and Others v. State of Madhya Pradesh and Others (2016) 7 SCC 353.

Precedent Relied : 6.15 State of Kerala had thereafter promulgated the Kerala Professional Colleges (Regularisation of Admissions in Medical Colleges) Ordinance, 2017 to regularise MBBS admissions in certain colleges against payment of Rs. 3,00,000/- (rupees three lakhs only) per student as a regularisation fee. The Ordinance was, however, held to be ultra vires by this Court in Medical Council of India v. State of Kerala and Others (2019) 13 SCC 185.

Precedent Relied : 7. To cut short the controversy, on 29th August, 2018, a consent order was passed by a two Judge Bench of this Court in Special Leave Petition (Civil) No. 23225 of 2018, The Principal, Kannur Medical College v. Admission Supervisory Committee, the relevant terms of which read as under:

Precedent Referred : 16. The primary contention of the ASC and the appellants is premised on the assertion that the students/guardians were compelled and forced to sign documents by the College even without informing them about the contents. Students/guardians were coerced as they required money at the earliest so that the students could take admission in some other college. Secondly, without discharge receipt, the College would not return the original certificates submitted by the students. Accordingly, these documents obtained under duress and coercion should not be accepted as valid 'No Dues Certificates'. In particular, reliance is placed on the decision dated 21st February, 2019 in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 1247 of 2018 titled Riya George v. Kannur Medical College and Others, wherein, this Court had noted the contention that the withdrawal of the complaint against KMC by the father of the student therein might not be voluntary and could be occasioned by the urgency to obtain certificates deposited with the College and refund of money, so as to secure the admission in another college.
