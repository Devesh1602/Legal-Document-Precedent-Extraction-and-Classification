Precedent Relied : 8. A statutory rule or Notification is to be treated as a part of the statute State of Tamil Nadu v. Hind Stone, (1982) 2 SCC 205. Rules made under a statute must be treated for all purposes of construction or obligation exactly as if they were in the Act, are to be of the same effect as if they are contained in the Act, and are to be judicially noticed for all purposes of construction or obligation The State of Uttar Pradesh and Ors v. Babu Ram Upadhya 1961 SCR (2) 679. The principles of interpretation of subordinate legislation are applicable to the interpretation of statutory Notifications Bansal Wire Industries Ltd. v. State of U.P., (2011) 6 SCC 545. If the words of the statute are in themselves precise and unambiguous, then no more can be necessary than to expound those words in their natural and ordinary sense. The words themselves do alone in such cases best declare the intent of the law-giver (1843-60) All ER Rep 55, Sussex Peerage case.

Precedent Referred : 9. It has been repeatedly held by this Court that where there is no ambiguity in the words, literal meaning has to be applied, which is the golden rule of interpretation. The words of a statute must prima facie be given their ordinary meaning Dental Council of India v. Hari Prakash, (2001) 8 SCC 61 and Harbhajan Singh v. Press Council of India, (2002) 3 SCC 722.

Precedent Relied : 11. It is a cardinal principle of interpretation that full effect has to be given to every word of the Notification South Central Railway Employees Coop. Credit Society Employees' Union v. Registrar of Coop. Societies. (1998) 2 SCC 580 And Bansal Wire Industries Ltd. v. State of U.P., (2011) 6 SCC 545. Interpreting the Notification dated 22.08.2013 to mean that every expansion of National Highway which is greater than 100 km requires prior environmental clearance would be making the other words in Item 7 (f) redundant and otiose.

Precedent Relied : 12. The learned Attorney General of India relied upon a judgment of this Court in CIT v. Surat Art Silk Cloth Manufacturers' Association (1980) 2 SCC 31 to highlight the importance of the word "involving" in Item 7 (f) of the Notification in which it was held as follows:

Precedent Relied : 14. It is submitted on behalf of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Government of India that environmental clearance is necessary only if the expansion project pertains to a National Highway which is greater than 100 km and involves additional right of way or land acquisition greater than 40 meters on existing alignments and 60 meters on realignments or by passes. In case of a doubt, the interpretation of the author of the Notification has to be accepted Silppi Construction Contractors v. Union of India, 2019 SCC OnLine SC 1133. Ergo, the opinion of the author of the notification i.e. the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change deserves to be accepted.

Precedent Referred : 16. In view of the bifurcation of the National Highway 45-A into four packages and each package being less than 100 km, the Appellant contended before the High Court that the Notifications dated 14.09.2006 and 22.08.2013 are not applicable. Seeking support from a judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana in Old Town Neighborhood Association v. Kauffman, (S.D. Ind. 2002), Case No. 1:02-cv-1505-DFH and a judgment of the European Court of Justice in Commission of the European Communities v. Kingdom of Spain Case C-227/01, the High Court held that segmentation of a project as a strategy to avoid environmental clearance is impermissible. The High Court also relied upon a judgment of this Court in Deepak Kumar v. State of Haryana (2012) 4 SCC 629 and a judgment of the National Green Tribunal in Citizens for Green Doon v. Union of India 2018 SCC OnLine NGT 1777 to reject the contention of the Appellants that the division of the project into four packages is for administrative expediencies. According to the High Court, if segmentation of National Highway projects is permitted, the Notifications dated 14.09.2006 and 22.08.2013 would become a dead letter as every National Highway beyond 100 km can be divided into packages to avoid environmental clearance.

Precedent Relied : 18. While economic development should not be allowed at the cost of ecology or by causing widespread environmental destruction, the necessity to preserve ecology and environment should not hamper economic and other development. Both development and environment must go hand in hand. In other words, there should not be development at the cost of environment and vice versa, but there should be development while taking due care and ensuring the protection of environment Indian Council for Enviro-Legal Action v. Union of India [(1996) 5 SCC 281]. The traditional concept that development and ecology are opposed to each other is no longer acceptable Vellore Citizens' Welfare Forum v. Union of India [(1996) 5 SCC 647].
