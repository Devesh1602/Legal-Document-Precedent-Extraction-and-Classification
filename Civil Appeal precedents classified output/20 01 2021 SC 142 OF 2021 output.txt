Precedent Referred : A four Judge Bench of this Court in Workmen of the Motipur Sugar Factory Private Ltd. v. Motipur Sugar Factory AIR 1965 SC 1803 held that :

Precedent Referred : "11. It is now well settled by a number of decisions of this Court that where an employer has failed to make an enquiry before dismissing or discharging a workman it is open to him to justify the action before the tribunal by leading all relevant evidence before it. In such a case the employer would not have the benefit which he had in cases where domestic enquiries have been held. The entire matter would be open before the tribunal which will have jurisdiction not only to go into the limited questions open to a tribunal where domestic enquiry has been property held (see Indian Iron & Steel Co. v. Workmen AIR: 1958 SC 130) but also to satisfy itself on the facts adduced before it by the employer whether the dismissal or discharge was justified. We may in this connection refer to Sana Musa Sugar Works (P) Limited v. Shobrati Khan AIR 1959 SC 923, Phulbari Tea Estate v. Workmen AIR 1959 SC 1111, and Punjab National Bank Limited v. Workmen AIR 1960 SC 160. These three cases were further considered by this Court in Bharat Sugar Mills Limited v. Jai Singh (1962) 3 SCR 684, and reference was also made to the decision of the Labour Appellate Tribunal in Ram Swarath Sinha v. Belsund Sugar Co. (1954) LAC 697. It was pointed out that "the important effect of omission to hold an enquiry was merely this: that the tribunal would not have to consider only whether there was a prima facie case but would decide for itself on the evidence adduced whether the charges have really been made out". It is true that three of these cases, except Phulbari Tea Estate case, were on applications under Section 23 of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. But in principle we see no difference whether the matter comes before the tribunal for approval under Section 33 or on a reference under Section 10 of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. In either case if the enquiry is defective or if no enquiry has been held as required by Standing Orders, the entire case would be open before the tribunal and the employer would have to justify on facts as well that its order of dismissal or discharge was proper. Phulbari Tea Estate case was on a reference under Section 10, and the same principle was applied there also, the only difference being that in that case there was an inquiry though it was defective. A defective enquiry in our opinion stands on the same footing as no enquiry and in either case the tribunal would have jurisdiction to go into the facts and the employer would have to satisfy the tribunal that on facts the order of dismissal or discharge was proper."

Precedent Referred : Subsequently in Delhi Cloth and General Mills Co. v. Ludh Budh Singh (1972) 1 SCC 595 this Court held that :

Precedent Referred : Reliance is also placed on the judgment of this Court in Workmen of Firestone Tyre & Rubber Co. of India (P) Ltd. v. The Management of Firestone Tyre & Rubber Co. of India (P) Ltd and Others. (1973) 1 SCC 813 wherein the broad principle regarding holding of the enquiry were spelt out as:

Precedent Referred : (10) In a particular case, after setting aside the order of dismissal, whether a workman should be reinstated or paid compensation is, as held by this Court in Management of Panitole Tea Estate v. Workmens (1971) 1 SCC 742 within the judicial decision of a Labour Court or Tribunal.

Precedent Referred : A division bench of this Court in Bhavnagar Municipal Corpn. v. Jadeja Govubha Chhanubha (2014) 16 SCC 130 held that :

Precedent Referred : "7. It is fairly well-settled that for an order of termination of the services of a workman to be held illegal on account of non-payment of retrenchment compensation, it is essential for the workman to establish that he was in continuous service of the employer within the meaning of Section 25-B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. For the respondent to succeed in that attempt he was required to show that he was in service for 240 days in terms of Section 25-B(2)(a)(ii). The burden to prove that he was in actual and continuous service of the employer for the said period lay squarely on the workman. The decisions of this Court in Range Forest Officer v. S.T. Hadimani (2002) 3 SCC 25, Municipal Corpn., Faridabad v. Siri Niwas (2004) 8 SCC 195, M.P. Electricity Board v. Hariram (2004) 8 SCC 246, Rajasthan State Ganganagar S. Mills Ltd. v. State of Rajasthan (2004) 8 SCC 161,: 2004 SCC (L&S) 1055], Surendranagar District Panchayat v. Jethabhai Pitamberbhai (2005) 8 SCC 450, and R.M. Yellatti v. Executive Engineer (2006) 1 SCC 106 unequivocally recognise the principle that the burden to prove that the workman had worked for 240 days is entirely upon him. So also the question whether an adverse inference could be drawn against the employer in case he did not produce the best evidence available with it, has been the subject-matter of pronouncements of this Court in Municipal Corpn., Faridabad v. Siri Niwas and M.P. Electricity Board v. Hariram [M.P. Electricity Board v. Hariram,, reiterated in RBI v. S. Mani (2005) 5 SCC 100. This Court has held that only because some documents have not been produced by the management, an adverse inference cannot be drawn against it."
