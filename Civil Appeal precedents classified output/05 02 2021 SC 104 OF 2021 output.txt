Precedent Referred : 10. The Maharashtra Administrative Tribunal vide Order dated 30.11.2019 vacated the interim Order dated 18.10.2019 on the ground that two of the Petitioners had appeared in the LDCE exam, but failed to qualify in the said examination; whilst the other Petitioners had not participated in the exam. It was also held that the Petitioners had failed to implead the 636 additional candidates who were directed to be appointed under the impugned G.R., and were necessary parties to be impleaded in the O.A. Reliance was placed on the Order passed by the Bombay High Court in W.P. No. 3555/2019 Nivrathi Venkatrao Gitte v. State of Maharashtra, wherein the same G.R. dated 22.04.2019 had been challenged. The High Court had directed that the process of selection may proceed, but would be subject to the results of the Writ Petition.
