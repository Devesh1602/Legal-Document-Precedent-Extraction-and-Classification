Precedent Relied : (v) Section 34(3) provides a maximum period of 120 days' after the receipt of the signed award, to file objections before the Court Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam Ltd. v. M/s Navigant Technologies Pvt. Ltd., C.A. No. 791 / 2021 decided on 02.03.2021.

Precedent Relied : Some of these provisions have been held to be mandatory, such as Sections 8 and 34(3); while others like Section 34(6) have been held to be directory State of Bihar & Ors. v. Bihar Rajya Bhumi Vikas Bank Samiti (2018) 9 SCC 472.

Precedent Referred : In Consolidated Engineering v. Principal Secretary, Irrigation, (2008) 7 SCC 169 this Court held that :

Precedent Referred : 12. The period of limitation for filing a petition seeking appointment of an arbitrator/s cannot be confused or conflated with the period of limitation applicable to the substantive claims made in the underlying commercial contract. The period of limitation for such claims is prescribed under various Articles of the Limitation Act, 1963. The limitation for deciding the underlying substantive disputes is necessarily distinct from that of filing an application for appointment of an arbitrator. This position was recognized even under Section 20 of the Arbitration Act 1940. Reference may be made to the judgment of this Court in C. Budhraja v. Chairman, Orissa Mining Corporation Ltd. (2008) 2 SCC 444. wherein it was held that Section 37(3) of the 1940 Act provides that for the purpose of the Limitation Act, an arbitration is deemed to have commenced when one party to the arbitration agreement serves on the other party, a notice requiring the appointment of an arbitrator. Paragraph 26 of this judgment reads as follows :

Precedent Referred : "26. Section 37(3) of the Act provides that for the purpose of the Limitation Act, an arbitration is deemed to have been commenced when one party to the arbitration agreement serves on the other party thereto, a notice requiring the appointment of an arbitrator. Such a notice having been served on 4-6-1980, it has to be seen whether the claims were in time as on that date. If the claims were barred on 4-6-1980, it follows that the claims had to be rejected by the arbitrator on the ground that the claims were barred by limitation. The said period has nothing to do with the period of limitation for filing a petition under Section 8(2) of the Act. Insofar as a petition under Section 8(2) is concerned, the cause of action would arise when the other party fails to comply with the notice invoking arbitration. Therefore, the period of limitation for filing a petition under Section 8(2) seeking appointment of an arbitrator cannot be confused with the period of limitation for making a claim. The decisions of this Court in Major (Retd.) Inder Singh Rekhi v. DDA [(1988) 2 SCC 338], Panchu Gopal Bose v. Board of Trustees for Port of Calcutta [(1993) 4 SCC 338] and Utkal Commercial Corpn. v. Central Coal Fields Ltd. [(1999) 2 SCC 571] also make this position clear."

Precedent Referred : 13. Various High Courts have taken the view that Article 137 of the Limitation Act would be applicable to an application under Section 11 of the Arbitration Act. The question of the applicability of Article 137 to applications under Section 11 of the 1996 Act came up for consideration before the Bombay High Court in Leaf Biotech v. Municipal Corporation Nashik 2010 (6) Mh LJ 316. wherein it was held that the period of limitation for an application u/S. 11 would be governed by Article 137 of the Limitation Act.

Precedent Referred : Subsequently, in Deepdharshan Builders Pvt. Ltd. v. Saroj (2019) 1 AIR Bom R 249. the Bombay High Court framed the following issue :

Precedent Referred : 14. Other decisions of High Courts on the applicability of Article 137 are Prasar Bharti v. Maa Communication 2010 (115) DRJ 438 (DB). and Golden Chariot v. Mukesh Panika 2018 SCC OnLine Del 10050, SLP (C) No. 40627 / 2018 against this decision was dismissed on 31.01.2019. passed by the Delhi High Court. The SLP filed in the case of Golden Chariot was dismissed vide Order dated 31.01.2019 in SLP(C) No. 3658 / 2019.

Precedent Referred : 16. In Geo Miller & Co. Pvt. Ltd. v. Chairman, Rajasthan Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Ltd., (2020) 14 SCC 643, 649. a three-judge bench held that on a reading of sub-sections (1) and (3) of Section 43 of the 1996 Act, the provisions of the Limitation Act, 1963 would be applicable to the Arbitration Act. Paragraph 14 of this judgment reads as :

Precedent Referred : "14. Sections 43(1) and (3) of the 1996 Act are in pari materia with Sections 37(1) and (4) of the 1940 Act. It is well-settled that by virtue of Article 137 of the First Schedule to the Limitation Act, 1963 the limitation period for reference of a dispute to arbitration or for seeking appointment of an arbitrator before a court under the 1940 Act (see State of Orissa v. Damodar Das [State of Orissa v. Damodar Das, (1996) 2 SCC 216]) as well as the 1996 Act (see Grasim Industries Ltd. v. State of Kerala [Grasim Industries Ltd. v. State of Kerala, (2018) 14 SCC 265 : (2018) 4 SCC (Civ) 612]) is three years from the date on which the cause of action or the claim which is sought to be arbitrated first arises."

Precedent Relied : 20. In SBP & Co. v. Patel Engineering Ltd., (2005) 8 SCC 618. a seven-Judge constitution bench of this Court considered the scope of Section 11 of the 1996 Act, and held that the scheme of the Act required the Chief Justice, or his designate, to decide whether there is an arbitration agreement in terms of Section 7, before exercising the default power for making the appointment of the arbitrator. The scope of power at the pre-reference stage would be as follows:

Precedent Relied : 21. Subsequently, in National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Boghara Polyfab Pvt. Ltd., (2009) 1 SCC 267. the Court classified the preliminary issues to be decided by the Chief Justice of India, / Chief Justice of a High Court, as the case may be, under Section 11, and those which must be decided by the arbitrator, into three categories :

Precedent Referred : 22. In Union of India & Ors. v. Master Construction Co.(2011) 12 SCC 349. this Court held that the issue whether a discharge voucher, or no claims certificate, or settlement agreement had been obtained by fraud, coercion, duress, or undue influence, must be determined by the appointing authority at the Section 11 stage, when a prima facie determination as to whether such a dispute was raised bonafide and genuine must be made. If the dispute prima facie appears to be lacking in credibility, the matter would not be referred to arbitration. A bald plea of fraud, coercion, duress, or undue influence was not sufficient, unless the party who sets up such a plea was able to prima facie establish it, by placing material on record.

Precedent Relied : 24. Sub-section (6A) came up for consideration in the case of Duro Felguera SA v. Gangavaram Port Ltd. (2017) 9 SCC 729., wherein this Court held that the legislative policy was to minimize judicial intervention at the appointment stage. In an application under Section 11, the Court should only look into the existence of the arbitration agreement, before making the reference. Post the 2015 amendments, all that the courts are required to examine is whether an arbitration agreement is in existence-nothing more, nothing less.

Precedent Relied : 59. The scope of the power under Section 11(6) of the 1996 Act was considerably wide in view of the decisions in SBP and Co. [SBP and Co. v. Patel Engg. Ltd., (2005) 8 SCC 618] and Boghara Polyfab [National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Boghara Polyfab (P) Ltd., (2009) 1 SCC 267 : (2009) 1 SCC (Civ) 117]. This position continued till the amendment brought about in 2015. After the amendment, all that the courts need to see is whether an arbitration agreement exists-nothing more, nothing less. The legislative policy and purpose is essentially to minimise the Court's intervention at the stage of appointing the arbitrator and this intention as incorporated in Section 11(6-A) ought to be respected."

Precedent Referred : 25. In Mayavati Trading Company Private Ltd. v. Pradyut Dev Burman (2019) 8 SCC 714., a three-judge bench held that the scope of power of the Court under Section 11 (6A) had to be construed in the narrow sense. In paragraph 10, it was opined as under :

Precedent Overruled : "10. This being the position, it is clear that the law prior to the 2015 Amendment that has been laid down by this Court, which would have included going into whether accord and satisfaction has taken place, has now been legislatively overruled. This being the position, it is difficult to agree with the reasoning contained in the aforesaid judgment [United India Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Antique Art Exports (P) Ltd., (2019) 5 SCC 362 : (2019) 2 SCC (Civ) 785], as Section 11(6-A) is confined to the examination of the existence of an arbitration agreement and is to be understood in the narrow sense as has been laid down in the judgment in Duro Felguera, SA [Duro Felguera, SA v. Gangavaram Port Ltd., (2017) 9 SCC 729"

Precedent Referred : 26. In Uttarakhand Purv Sainik Kalyan Nigam v. Northern Coal Field Limited, (2020) 2 SCC 455. this Court took note of the recommendations of the Law Commission in its 246th Report, the relevant extract of which reads as :

Precedent Distinguished : 33. In Swisbourgh Diamond Mines (Pty) Ltd. & Ors. v. Kingdom of Lesotho [2019] 1 SLR 263., the Singapore Court of Appeal distinguished between "jurisdiction" and "admissibility" in paragraphs 207 and 208, which read as :

Precedent Relied : "207. Jurisdiction is commonly defined to refer to the "power of the tribunal to hear a case", whereas admissibility refers to "whether it is appropriate for the tribunal to hear it" : Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States ICSID Case No. ARB (AF) / 98 / 2, Dissenting Opinion of Keith Highet (8 May 2000) at [58]. To this, Zachary Douglas adds clarity to this discussion by referring to "jurisdiction" as a concept that deals with "the existence of [the] adjudicative power" of an arbitral tribunal, and to "admissibility" as a concept dealing with "the exercise of that power" and the suitability of the claim brought pursuant to that power for adjudication:[Zachary Douglas, The Press, 2009] at paras 291 and 310.

Precedent Distinguished : 34. The judgment in Lesotho (supra) was followed by in BBA & Ors. v. BAZ & Anr., [2020] SGCA 53. wherein the Court of Appeal held that statutory time bars go towards admissibility. The Court held that the "tribunal versus claim" test should be applied for purposes of distinguishing whether an issue goes towards jurisdiction or admissibility. The "tribunal versus claim" test asks whether the objection is targeted at the tribunal (in the sense that the claim should not be arbitrated due to a defect in or omission to consent to arbitration), or at the claim (in that the claim itself is defective and should not be raised at all).

Precedent Referred : 36. In a recent judgment delivered by a three-judge bench in Vidya Drolia v. Durga Trading Corporation (2021) 2 SCC 1., on the scope of power under Sections 8 and 11, it has been held that the Court must undertake a primary first review to weed out "manifestly ex facie non-existent and invalid arbitration agreements, or non-arbitrable disputes." The prima facie review at the reference stage is to cut the deadwood, where dismissal is bare faced and pellucid, and when on the facts and law, the litigation must stop at the first stage. Only when the Court is certain that no valid arbitration agreement exists, or that the subject matter is not arbitrable, that reference may be refused.

Precedent Referred : "148. Section 43(1) of the Arbitration Act states that the Limitation Act, 1963 shall apply to arbitrations as it applies to court proceedings. Sub-section (2) states that for the purposes of the Arbitration Act and Limitation Act, arbitration shall be deemed to have commenced on the date referred to in Section 21. Limitation law is procedural and normally disputes, being factual, would be for the arbitrator to decide guided by the facts found and the law applicable. The court at the referral stage can interfere only when it is manifest that the claims are ex facie time-barred and dead, or there is no subsisting dispute. All other cases should be referred to the Arbitral Tribunal for decision on merits. Similar would be the position in case of disputed "no-claim certificate" or defence on the plea of novation and "accord and satisfaction". As observed in Premium Nafta Products Ltd. [Fili Shipping Co. Ltd. v. Premium Nafta Products Ltd., 2007 UKHL 40 : 2007 Bus LR 1719 (HL)], it is not to be expected that commercial men while entering transactions inter se would knowingly create a system which would require that the court should first decide whether the contract should be rectified or avoided or rescinded, as the case may be, and then if the contract is held to be valid, it would require the arbitrator to resolve the issues that have arisen."

Precedent Relied : 37. The upshot of the judgment in Vidya Drolia is affirmation of the position of law expounded in Duro Felguera and Mayavati Trading, which continue to hold the field. It must be understood clearly that Vidya Drolia has not re-surrected the pre-amendment position on the scope of power as held in SBP & Co. v. Patel Engineering (supra).

Precedent Referred : The period of limitation for issuing notice of arbitration would not get extended by mere exchange of letters, S.S.Rathore v. State of Madhya Pradesh (1989) 4 SCC 582.

Precedent Referred : Union of India & Ors. v. Har Dayal (2010) 1 SCC 394.

Precedent Referred : CLP India Private Limited v. Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited & Anr. (2020) 5 SCC 185. or mere settlement discussions, where a final bill is rejected by making deductions or otherwise. Sections 5 to 20 of the Limitation Act do not exclude the time taken on account of settlement discussions. Section 9 of the Limitation Act makes it clear that : "where once the time has begun to run, no subsequent disability or inability to institute a suit or make an application stops it." There must be a clear notice invoking arbitration setting out the "particular dispute" Section 21 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. (including claims / amounts) which must be received by the other party within a period of 3 years from the rejection of a final bill, failing which, the time bar would prevail.
