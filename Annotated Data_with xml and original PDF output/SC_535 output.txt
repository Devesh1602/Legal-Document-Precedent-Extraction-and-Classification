Precedent Referred : Now, the authorities are clear that it is not unconstitutional for the legislature to leave it to the executive to determine details relating to the working of taxation laws, such as the selection of persons on whom the tax is to be laid, the rates at which it is to be charged in respect of different classes of goods, and the like.In Powell v. Appollo Candle Company Limited (1885) 10 A.C. 2821885 (10) AC 282. the question arose as to whether s. 133 of the Customs Regulation Act of 1879 of New South Wales which conferred a power on the Governor to impose tax on certain articles of import was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative powers.In holding that it was not, the Privy Council observed:" It is argued that the tax in question has been imposed by the Governor and not by the Legislature who alone had power to impose it.

Precedent Referred : "In Syed Mohamed &amp; Co. v. The State of Madras ((1952) 3 S.T.C.3671952 (3) STC 3671952 ILO MAD 41), the question was as to the vires of rules 4 and 16 framed under the Madras General Sales Tax Act.
