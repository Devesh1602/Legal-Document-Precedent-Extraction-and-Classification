Precedent Referred : This was the view taken in M. S. Sheriff v. Govindan [A. I. R. 1951 Mad.10601951 AIR(Mad) 1060, 1061.

Precedent Referred : S. Sheriff v. The State of Madras and Others [[1954] S. C. R. 11441954 SCR 1144, 1147.]was quoted but the present point was neither considered nor decided there.The next question is whether the Court of the Senior Subordinate Judge is the same Court as Mr. Barlow's Court, namely the Court of the Subordinate Judge of the first class.

Precedent Referred : Keshardeo Chamria v. Radha Kissen Chamria and Others [[1953] S. C. R. 1361953 SCR 136, 150 to 152.]and many cases from the High Courts were cited which show that there is much difference of opinion about this but we are fortunately not called upon to decide that question because this is not a case where a Court with jurisdiction has acted under section 476 of the Criminal Procedure Code of its own motion or has acted as a Court of appeal under section 476-B.
