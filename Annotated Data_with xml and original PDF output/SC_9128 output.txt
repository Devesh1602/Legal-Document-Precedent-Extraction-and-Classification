Precedent Relied : Mention may be made in this connection to the observations of this Court in State of Maharashtra v. Mayer Hans George, AIR 1965 SC 7221965 AIR(SC) 7221964 ILO SC 5 which are as follows :- "It is the settled rule of the Supreme Court that it would not interfere with the sentence passed by the Courts below unless there is an illegality in it or the same involves any question of principle."11.

Precedent Referred : It is pertinent to mention here the observations made by this Court in Pritam Singh v. The State, AIR 1950 SC 1691950 AIR(SC) 1691950 ILO SC 6 which are as follows :- "It will not grant special leave to appeal under Article 136(1) of the Constitution unless it is shown that exceptional and special circumstances exist, that substantial and grave injustice has been done and the case in question presents features of sufficient gravity to warrant a review of the decision appealed against and that only those points can be urged at the final hearing of the appeal which are fit to be urged at the preliminary stage when leave is asked for.It is well established that this Court does not by special leave convert itself into a court to review evidence for a third time.

Precedent Relied : This decision has been relied upon and followed in a subsequent decision of this Court in Sadhu Singh v. State of Pepsu, AIR 1954 SC 2711954 AIR(SC) 2711953 ILO SC 12614.In the premise aforesaid, we do not find any infirmity far less any illegality or failure of justice which would impel us to interfere with the order of conviction and sentence concurrently arrived at by both the courts below15.
