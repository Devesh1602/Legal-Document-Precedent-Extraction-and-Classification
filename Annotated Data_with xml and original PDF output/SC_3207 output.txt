Precedent Relied : As observed by this Court in The United Commercial Bank Ltd., Calcutta v. The Commissioner of Income-tax, West Bengal([1959] S.C.R.791959 SCR 79.)

Precedent Relied : The fact that under sub-s. (2) of s. 26 liability is imposed upon the successor to pay tax on behalf of his predecessor or to be assessed in respect of the income of the person succeeded for the previous year, will not, in our judgment, be sufficient to hold that the exemption which has been granted in consequence of double taxation under the Acts of 1918 and 1922 also must be restricted to income which is taxable under s. 10.We may briefly refer to the decision of this Court in The Commissioner of Income-tax, Madras v. The Express Newspapers Limited, Madras([1964] 8 S.C.R.1891964 (8) SCR 1891964 ILO SC 349).
