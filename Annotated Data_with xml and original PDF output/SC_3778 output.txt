Precedent Referred : The Privy Council in Bhuboni Sahu v. The King ((1949) L.R.76.

Precedent Referred : in R. v. Baskerville ([1916] 2 K.B.6581916 (2) KB 6581951 ILO SC 24.)

Precedent Referred : But it has been long a rule of practice at common law for the judge to warn the jury of the danger of convicting a prisoner on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice, and in the discretion of the Judge, to advise them not to convict upon such evidence, but the judge should point out to the jury that it is within their legal province to convict upon such unconfirmed evidence (R. v. Stubbs, Dears 555; In re Heunier, 1894 2 Q.B.415)" .We, therefore, allow this appeal, set aside the order of conviction and direct that the appellant be released forthwith.
