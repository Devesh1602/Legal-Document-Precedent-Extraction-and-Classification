Precedent Referred : This Court has held in Kalyan v. State of U.P., (2001) 9 SCC 632 : (AIR 2001 SC 3976) :8.The settled position of law on the powers to be exercised by the High Court in an appeal against an order of acquittal is that though the High Court has full powers to review the evidence upon which an order of acquittal is passed, it is equally well settled that the presumption of innocence of the accused persons, as envisaged under the criminal jurisprudence prevalent in our country is further reinforced by his acquittal by the trial court.
