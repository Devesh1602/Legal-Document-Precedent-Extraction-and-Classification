Precedent Relied : 417 of 2019 (Nasreen vs. Dharmendra) under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, Police Station- Kotwali, District-Jaunpur as well as summoning order dated 07.08.2019, pending in the Court of Judicial Magistrate-Ist, Jaunpur and non-bailable warrants issued on 08.01.2021, on a singular ground that the impugned order dated 07.08.2019 does not disclose that complainant had appeared before the court concerned and had given his evidence under Sections 200-202 Cr.P.C.3.Sri Janardan Prakash opposes the prayer made by learned counsel for applicant.4.

Precedent Referred : In case of Radhey Shyam Garg vs. Naresh Kumar Gupta; (2009) 13 SCC 201 : (AIR 2010 SC 3210), it is held thatif affidavit in terms of the provisions of Section 145 of the Act is to be considered to be an evidence, it is difficult to comprehend as to why the court will ask the deponent of the said affidavit to examine himself with regard to the contents thereof once over again.He may be cross-examined and upon completion of his evidence, he may be re- examined.6.

Precedent Referred : Similarly, in case of Mandvi Co-operative Bank Ltd. vs. Nimesh B. Thakore; (2010) 3 SCC 83 : (AIR 2010 SC 1402), the Supreme Court has held thatonce it is realized that Sections 143 to 147 were designed especially to lay down a much simplified procedure for the trial of dishonoured cheque cases with the sole object that the trial of those cases should follow a course even swifter than a summary trial and once it is seen that even the special procedure failed to effectively and expeditiously handle the vast multitude of cases coming to the court, the claim of the accused that on being summoned under Section 145(2), the complainant or any of his witnesses whose evidence is given on affidavit must be made to depose in examination-in- chief all over again plainly appears to be a demand for meaningless duplication, apparently aimed at delaying the trial.Section 145 of the Act has excluded the provisions of Code of Criminal Procedure with regard to the manner in which evidence of the complainant is to be taken.

Precedent Referred : In case of Sachin Agarwal vs. State of U.P.; (2011) 75 ACC : (2011 (6) ALJ 648) 482, it has been held thatthe Magistrate was required to observe the provisions contained in sections 200 and 202 Cr.P.C.
