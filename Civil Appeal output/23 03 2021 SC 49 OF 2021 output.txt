Legislation : "UTTAR PRADESH CO-OPERATIVE SOCIEITES ACT, 1965 for short, the 'Act'

Legislation : subs.by U.P. Act 17 of 1977 (w.e.f.3-10-1975) 122-A. Centralisation of certain services.- (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, the State Government may by rules provide for the creation of one there services of such employees of such co-operative societies or class of co-operative societies as the Stale Government may think fit, common to such co-operative societies and prescribe the method of recruitment, appointment, removal and other conditions of service of persons appointed to any such service.

Statute : 26. On 16.04.1976, Section 122-A was inserted in the 1965 Act which now provided for centralization of services. This Section opens with a non-obstante clause and thus, the intent is to give an overriding effect over the general regime contemplated by Sections 121 and 122 of the 1965 Act. Section 122-A of the 1965 Act empowers the Government, by rules, to provide for creation of one or more services of employees of such co-operative society or class of co-operative societies as the Government may think fit and prescribe inter alia conditions of service including appointment and removal of persons appointed to such service.

Statute : 27. It was in exercise of power conferred under Section 122-A of the 1965 Act that 1984 Rules were framed. Rule 15 of the 1984 Rules stipulates that the appointing authority and the authority exercising disciplinary control over the members of the service shall be such as may be laid down in the Regulations and till such Regulations are brought in force, 'the Chairman of the Committee shall be the appointing authority and the authority exercising disciplinary control over them'.

Statute : 28. In terms of the specific statutory regime referable to Section 122-A of the 1965 Act, Rule 15 thus, would be the governing principle rather than Regulation 87 framed in exercise of regulation making power referable to the general dispensation under Sections 121 and 122 of the 1965 Act. Rule 15 does not contemplate that the Chairman of the Committee is required to have any prior concurrence of any authority.
