Statute : 2. The State of Uttar Pradesh was reorganized under the Uttar Pradesh Reorganization Act, 2000 (hereinafter referred to as "the Act"). The State of Uttarakhand was created pursuant to the said Act. The Central Government issued guidelines on 30.09.2000 for allocation of erstwhile employees of the State of Uttar Pradesh amongst the two States. A tentative final allocation list was prepared and circulated to the employees calling for their objections, if they were aggrieved by the proposed final allocation. A State Advisory Committee was constituted by the Central Government. The State Advisory Committee prepared a list of State Civil Service (SCS) Officers on the basis of their seniority for allocation to the State of Uttarakhand. Though, some of the officers joined the services in the State of Uttarakhand, there were others who objected to their allotment. Writ Petitions were filed in the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad questioning the allotment to the State of Uttarakhand. Appellant No.2 was also a party to the Writ Petition. The High Court stayed the orders of allocation during the pendency of the Writ Petitions.
