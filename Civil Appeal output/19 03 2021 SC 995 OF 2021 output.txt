Legislation : 4. Given the fact that an appellate proceeding is a continuation of the original proceeding, as has been held in Lachmeshwar Prasad Shukul v. Keshwar Lal Chaudhuri [Lachmeshwar Prasad Shukul v. Keshwar Lal Chaudhuri, 1940 SCC OnLine FC 10 : AIR 1941 FC 5], and repeatedly followed by our judgments, we feel that any delay beyond 120 days in the filing of an appeal under Section 37 from an application being either dismissed or allowed under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 should not be allowed as it will defeat the overall statutory purpose of arbitration proceedings being decided with utmost despatch.

Legislation : 4. We may only add that what we have done in the aforesaid judgment is to add to the period of 90 days, which is provided by statute for filing of appeals under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act, a grace period of 30 days under Section 5 of the Limitation Act by following Lachmeshwar Prasad Shukul [Lachmeshwar Prasad Shukul v. Keshwar Lal Chaudhuri, 1940 SCC OnLine FC 10 : AIR 1941 FC 5], as also having regard to the object of speedy resolution of all arbitral disputes which was uppermost in the minds of the framers of the 1996 Act, and which has been strengthened from time to time by amendments made thereto. The present delay being beyond 120 days is not liable, therefore, to be condoned."

Statute : 3. In two of the three appeals before us, i.e., Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 665 of 2021 and Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) Diary No.18079 of 2020, the High Courts of Bombay and Delhi vide judgments dated 17.12.2020 and 15.10.2019 respectively, dismissed the appeals filed by the Government of Maharashtra and by the Union of India respectively, refusing to condone the delay in the filing of the appeal under section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 ["Arbitration Act"] beyond 120 days. So far as the Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No.15278 of 2020 is concerned, the High Court of Madhya Pradesh refused to follow the judgment of this Court in N.V. International (supra) stating that there is a conflict between this judgment and the judgment of a larger Bench of this Court reported in Consolidated Engg. Enterprises v. Irrigation Deptt., (2008) 7 SCC 169 ["Consolidated Engg."]. It was, therefore, held that it was open for the High Court to condone the delay applying section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963 ["Limitation Act"] and, as a matter of fact, a delay of what was stated to be 57 days was condoned.

Statute : 4. Shri Sandeep Sudhakar Deshmukh, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Government of Maharashtra (Water Resources Department) ["Govt of Maharashtra"], the appellant in Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 665 of 2021, submitted that the Arbitration Act in its original avatar did not include the concept or idea of expeditious resolution of disputes. At best, the Arbitration Act can be treated as a mechanism providing for alternate dispute resolution. This original objective is continued by the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015 ["2015 Amendment"] which provides a time limit for arbitral awards and for fast track procedure contained in sections 29A and 29B of the Arbitration Act. This being the case, the very foundation of N.V. International (supra) is erroneous in law. Shri Deshmukh also argued that section 37 of the Arbitration Act provides for appeals from several orders, including orders made under sections 8, 9, 16 and 17, apart from orders that may be made under section 34 of the Arbitration Act. According to him, the rationale or logic contained in N.V. International (supra) would perhaps apply only to appeals from section 34 orders, but not to orders that are passed under any of the other aforesaid sections, as there is no hard and fast application of a 120-day limitation period when it comes to applications that have been filed under any of these sections.

Statute : 6. Ms. Aishwarya Bhati, learned Additional Solicitor General appearing on behalf of the Union of India, the appellant in the Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) Diary No. 18079 of 2020, read in detail the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 ["Commercial Courts Act"] and referred to the two Law Commission Reports which led to its enactment, namely the 188th Law Commission Report and the 253rd Law Commission Report. She then referred to this Court's judgments in Kandla Export Corpn. v. OCI Corpn., (2018) 14 SCC 715 ["Kandla Export Corpn"] and BGS SGS SOMA JV v. NHPC, (2020) 4 SCC 234, dealing with the interplay between section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act and section 37 of the Arbitration Act. She argued that a limitation period of 60 days was laid down by section 13(1A) of the Commercial Courts Act, and though section 14 thereof commands that an expeditious disposal of appeals take place within a period of six months from the date of filing such appeal, neither of the two provisions bound appellate courts not to apply section 5 of the Limitation Act to relax the period of limitation in deserving cases. She also relied upon section 12A of the Commercial Courts Act, which speaks of the Limitation Act in the context of the Commercial Courts Act. She then referred to section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act read with the Schedule, and, in particular, the amendment made to Order VIII Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 ["CPC"] which closes the right of defence after a certain period of limitation is over, which is to be contrasted with section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, which contains no such provision. She then referred to judgments under different statutes such as the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 ["IBC"] and the Electricity Act, 2003 in which section 5 of the Limitation Act becomes inapplicable by virtue of either the scheme of the statute in question or by virtue of an "express exclusion" spoken of in section 29(2) of the Limitation Act.

Statute : 12. Dr. Amit George, learned counsel appearing for M/s Associated Construction Co., the respondent in the Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) Diary No. 18079 of 2020, argued that section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, having regard to the object of speedy disposal sought to be achieved, excludes the application of section 5 of the Limitation Act altogether. For this purpose, he relied heavily upon the judgment of this Court in Kandla Export Corpn (supra) and the judgment of this Court in CCE & Customs v. Hongo India (P) Ltd., (2009) 5 SCC 791 ["Hongo"] which dealt with section 35-H(1) of the Central Excise Act, 1944 ["Central Excise Act"]. He also relied upon other judgments which interpreted section 29(2) of the Limitation Act to state that the scheme of a particular statute may make it clear that there is an "express exclusion" of section 5 of the Limitation Act, which is the case under the Commercial Courts Act. He then relied strongly upon the judgment in N.V. International (supra) by supporting its logic and citing judgments which would show that other sections of the Limitation Act were excluded in the context of section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act - such as sections 4 and 17 of the Limitation Act. In any case, he argued that on facts sufficient cause had not been made out, and that the judgment of the High Court of Delhi dated 15.10.2019 ought to be set aside on this ground also.

Legislation : (1) The Limitation Act, 1963 (36 of 1963), shall apply to arbitrations as it applies to proceedings in court.

Legislation : (2) For the purposes of this section and the Limitation Act, 1963 (36 of 1963), an arbitration shall be deemed to have commenced on the date referred to in section 21.

Legislation : (4) Where the Court orders that an arbitral award be set aside, the period between the commencement of the arbitration and the date of the order of the Court shall be excluded in computing the time prescribed by the Limitation Act, 1963 (36 of 1963), for the commencement of the proceedings (including arbitration) with respect to the dispute so submitted."

Legislation : (1) If such arbitration is an international commercial arbitration, all applications or appeals arising out of such arbitration under the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996) that have been filed in a High Court, shall be heard and disposed of by the Commercial Division where such Commercial Division has been constituted in such High Court.

Legislation : (2) If such arbitration is other than an international commercial arbitration, all applications or appeals arising out of such arbitration under the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996) that have been filed on the original side of the High Court, shall be heard and disposed of by the Commercial Division where such Commercial Division has been constituted in such High Court.

Legislation : (3) If such arbitration is other than an international commercial arbitration, all applications or appeals arising out of such arbitration under the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996) that would ordinarily lie before any principal civil court of original jurisdiction in a district (not being a High Court) shall be filed in, and heard and disposed of by the Commercial Court exercising territorial jurisdiction over such arbitration where such Commercial Court has been constituted.

Legislation : Provided that an appeal shall lie from such orders passed by a Commercial Division or a Commercial Court that are specifically enumerated under Order XLIII of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) as amended by this Act and section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996).

Legislation : 42. The AC Act is no doubt, a special law, consolidating and amending the law relating to arbitration and matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. The AC Act does not prescribe the period of limitation, for various proceedings under that Act, except where it intends to prescribe a period different from what is prescribed in the Limitation Act. On the other hand, Section 43 makes the provisions of the Limitation Act, 1963 applicable to proceedings-both in court and in arbitration-under the AC Act. There is also no express exclusion of application of any provision of the Limitation Act to proceedings under the AC Act, but there are some specific departures from the general provisions of the Limitation Act, as for example, the proviso to Section 34(3) and sub-sections (2) to (4) of Section 43 of the AC Act.

Legislation : "14. Here the history and scheme of the 1996 Act support the conclusion that the time-limit prescribed under Section 34 to challenge an award is absolute and unextendible by court under Section 5 of the Limitation Act. The Arbitration and Conciliation Bill, 1995 which preceded the 1996 Act stated as one of its main objectives the need "to minimise the supervisory role of courts in the arbitral process" [Para 4(v) of the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996]. This objective has found expression in Section 5 of the Act which prescribes the extent of judicial intervention in no uncertain terms:

Legislation : 15. The "Part" referred to in Section 5 is Part I of the 1996 Act which deals with domestic arbitrations. Section 34 is contained in Part I and is therefore subject to the sweep of the prohibition contained in Section 5 of the 1996 Act."

Legislation : "25.... It is true that the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 intended to expedite commercial issues expeditiously. It is also clear in the Statement of Objects and Reasons that in order to recognise economic reforms the settlement of both domestic and international commercial disputes should be disposed of quickly so that the country's economic progress be expedited..."

Legislation : "8. The Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act, 2015 came into force on 23-10-2015 bringing in their wake certain amendments to the Code of Civil Procedure. In Order 5 Rule 1, sub-rule (1), for the second proviso, the following proviso was substituted:

Legislation : 9. In Bihar Rajya Bhumi Vikas Bank Samiti [State of Bihar v. Bihar Rajya Bhumi Vikas Bank Samiti, (2018) 9 SCC 472 : (2018) 4 SCC (Civ) 387], a question was raised as to whether Section 34(5) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, inserted by Amending Act 3 of 2016 is mandatory or directory. In para 11 of the said judgment, this Court referred to Kailash v. Nanhku [Kailash v. Nanhku, (2005) 4 SCC 480], referring to the text of Order 8 Rule 1 as it stood pre the amendment made by the Commercial Courts Act. It also referred (in para 12) to Salem Advocate Bar Assn. (2) v. Union of India [Salem Advocate Bar Assn. (2) v. Union of India, (2005) 6 SCC 344], which, like the Kailash [Kailash v. Nanhku, (2005) 4 SCC 480] judgment, held that the mere expression "shall" in Order 8 Rule 1 would not make the provision mandatory. This Court then went on to discuss in para 17 of State v. N.S. Gnaneswaran [State v. N.S. Gnaneswaran, (2013) 3 SCC 594 : (2013) 3 SCC (Cri) 235 : (2013) 1 SCC (L&S) 688], in which Section 154(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure was held to be directory inasmuch as no consequence was provided if the section was breached. In para 22 by way of contrast to Section 34, Section 29-A of the Arbitration Act was set out. This Court then noted in para 23 as under: (Bihar Rajya Bhumi Vikas Bank Samiti case [State of Bihar v. Bihar Rajya Bhumi Vikas Bank Samiti, (2018) 9 SCC 472 : (2018) 4 SCC (Civ) 387], SCC p. 489)

Legislation : 36. The scheme of the Central Excise Act, 1944 supports the conclusion that the time-limit prescribed under Section 35-H(1) to make a reference to the High Court is absolute and unextendable by a court under Section 5 of the Limitation Act. It is well-settled law that it is the duty of the court to respect the legislative intent and by giving liberal interpretation, limitation cannot be extended by invoking the provisions of Section 5 of the Limitation Act."

Legislation : (6) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Limitation Act, 1963 (36 of 1963) or in any other law for the time being in force, in computing the period of limitation specified for any suit or application by or against a corporate debtor for which an order of moratorium has been made under this Part, the period during which such moratorium is in place shall be excluded."

Legislation : 104. Mr Sanjay R. Hegde, the learned Amicus Curiae, has argued before us that the interpretation of Section 2(1)(d) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 cannot include "mental" age as such an interpretation would be beyond the "Lakshman Rekha" - that is, it is no part of this Court's function to add to or amend the law as it stands. This Court's function is limited to interpreting the law as it stands, and this being the case, he has exhorted us not to go against the plain literal meaning of the statute.

Statute : 54. The expression "sufficient cause" contained in section 5 of the Limitation Act is elastic enough to yield different results depending upon the object and context of a statute. Thus, in Ajmer Kaur v. State of Punjab, (2004) 7 SCC 381, this Court, in the context of section 11(5) of the Punjab Land Reforms Act, 1972, held as follows:

Legislation : 11. The above reasoning is in consonance with the provision in sub-section (7) of Section 11 of the Act. Sub-section (7) uses the words "where succession has opened after the surplus area or any part thereof has been determined by the Collector...". The words "determined by the Collector" would mean that the order of the Collector has attained finality. The provisions regarding appeals, etc. contained in Sections 80-82 of the Punjab Tenancy Act, 1887, as made applicable to proceedings under the Punjab Land Reforms Act, 1972, show that the maximum period of limitation in case of appeal or review is ninety days. The appeal against the final order of the Collector dated 30-9-1976 whereby 3.12 hectares of land had been declared as surplus was dismissed on 27-3-1979. The order was allowed to become final as it was not challenged any further. Thus the determination by the Collector became final on 27-3-1979. The same could not be reopened after a lapse of more than 6 years by order dated 23-7-1985. The subsequent proceedings before the Revenue Authorities did not lie. The order dated 23-7-1985 is non est. All the subsequent proceedings therefore fall through. The issue could not have been reopened."

Statute : 55. Nearer home, in Brahampal v. National Insurance Company, 2020 SCC OnLine SC 1053, this Court specifically referred to the difference between a delay in filing commercial claims under the Arbitration Act or the Commercial Courts Act and claims under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, as follows:

Legislation : "22. Therefore, the aforesaid provision being a beneficial legislation, must be given liberal interpretation to serve its object. Keeping in view the substantive rights of the parties, undue emphasis should not be given to technicalities. In such cases delay in filing and refiling cannot be viewed strictly, as compared to commercial claims under the Arbitration and Concilliation Act, 1996 or the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. In P. Radha Bai v. P. Ashok Kumar, (2019) 13 SCC 445, wherein this Court while interpreting Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, held that the right to object to an award itself is substantively bound with the limitation period prescribed therein and the same cannot merely a procedural prescription. In effect the Court held that a complete petition, has to be filed within the time prescribed under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act and 'not thereafter'. The Court while coming to the aforesaid conclusion, reasoned as under:
