Precedent : (E) A Single Judge of the High Court by his order dated 16.12.2013 rejected said writ petition. Relying on the decision of this Court in Secretary, State of Karnataka & Ors. vs. Umadevi & Ors. (2006) 4 SCC 1, it was observed:-

Precedent : "2. All the issues which have been urged in the present petition stand settled against the petitioners by the Constitution Bench judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Secretary, State of Karnataka & Ors. vs. Umadevi & Ors., (2006) 4 SCC 1. The Supreme Court in the case of Umadevi (supra) has laid down the following ratio:-

Precedent : It was submitted by Mr. Santosh Kumar, learned Advocate that the directions issued by the Division Bench of the High Court were not consistent with the law declared by this Court in Umadevi (2006) 4 SCC 1 and the subsequent decisions of this Court including that in Official Liquidator vs. Dayanand and Ors. (2008) 10 SCC 1. With regard to the ensuing selection to be undertaken where the benefits in terms of paragraphs 6 and 7 of the affidavit dated 09.03.2021 would be extended, it was submitted that the total marks in the test would be 300 and grant of 10 marks would mean 3.33% advantage.

Precedent : On the other hand, Mr. Gonsalves, learned Senior Advocate submitted that even after the decision of this Court in Umadevi (2006) 4 SCC 1, this Court extended the benefit of regularization in certain cases. He relied upon the decisions of this Court in State of Karnataka and others vs. M.L. Kesari and others (2010) 9 SCC 247 [Paras 7 & 8]; State of Gujarat and others vs. PWD Employees Union and others (2013) 12 SCC 417 [Para 27]; Nihal Singh and others vs. State of Punjab and others (2013) 14 SCC 65; Sheo Narain Nagar and others vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and others (2017) 14 SCALE 247 [Para 8] = (2018) 13 SCC 432; and Narendra Kumar Tiwari and others vs. State of Jharkhand and others (2018) 8 SCC 238.

Precedent : 8. The decision in Umadevi (2006) 4 SCC 1 and other relevant decisions on the point were considered by a Bench of three Judges of this Court in Official Liquidator vs. Dayanand and others (2008) 10 SCC 1. In that case, the decisions of the Calcutta High Court and the Delhi High Court were under challenge. The Single Judge of the Calcutta High Court had directed absorption of Group 'C' staff, which direction was affirmed by the Division Bench. Similarly, a Single Judge of the Delhi High Court had directed absorption of the writ petitioners in their appropriate scales with benefits such as fitment and promotions which directions were affirmed in appeal by the Division Bench. This Court accepted the challenge and set aside the directions issued by the Calcutta High Court and the Delhi High Court. During the course of its Judgment, this Court made following observations:-

Precedent : 75. By virtue of Article 141 of the Constitution, the judgment of the Constitution Bench in Umadevi (2006) 4 SCC 1 is binding on all the courts including this Court till the same is overruled by a larger Bench. The ratio of the Constitution Bench judgment has been followed by different two-Judge Benches for declining to entertain the claim of regularisation of service made by ad hoc/temporary/daily-wage/casual employees or for reversing the orders of the High Court granting relief to such employees - Indian Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Ltd. v. Workmen (2007) 1 SCC 408, Gangadhar Pillai v. Siemens Ltd. (2007) 1 SCC 533, Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan v. L.V. Subramanyeswara (2007) 5 SCC 326, Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. v. Dan Bahadur Singh (2007) 6 SCC 207. However, in U.P. SEB v. Pooran Chandra Pandey (2007) 11 SCC 92 on which reliance has been placed by Shri Gupta, a two-Judge Bench has attempted to dilute the Constitution Bench judgment by suggesting that the said decision cannot be applied to a case where regularisation has been sought for in pursuance of Article 14 of the Constitution and that the same is in conflict with the judgment of the seven-Judge Bench in Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India (1978) 1 SCC 248."
