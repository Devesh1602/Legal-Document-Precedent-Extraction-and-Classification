Precedent : It was further submitted that the dissenting opinion has been held to be the correct view by the Courts in various cases. Reliance was placed on the judgment of this Court in Ssangyong Engineering and Construction Co. ltd. v. NHAI., 2019 (15) SCC 131 wherein the dissenting opinion was upheld as being the correct view, and was affirmed. Reference was made to the judgment of the Bombay High Court in Axios Navigation v. Indian Oil Corporation, 2012 SCC Online Bom 4 wherein it was held that the view of the minority was relevant for the adjudication of objections under Section 34 of the Act.

Precedent : Reliance was placed on the judgments of the Delhi and Bombay High Court in Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd. v. Acome and Ors. AIR 2009 Delhi 102, Axion Navigation v. Indian Oil Corporation Ltd., (2012) 114 (1) Bom LR 392 and Oriental insurance Co. v.

Precedent : (x) In Union of India v. Tecco Trichy Engineers & Contractors (2005) 4 SCC 239. a three-judge bench of this Court held that the period of limitation for filing an application u/S. 34 would commence only after a valid delivery of the award takes place u/S. 31(5) of the Act.

Precedent : (xi) The judgment in Tecco Trichy Engineers (supra) was followed in State of Maharashtra v. Ark Builders, (2011) 4 SCC 616. wherein this Court held that Section 31(1) obliges the members of the arbitral tribunal to make the award in writing and sign it. The legal requirement under sub-section (5) of Section 31 is the delivery of a copy of the award signed by the members of the arbitral tribunal / arbitrator, and not any copy of the award. On a harmonious construction of Section 31(5) read with Section 34(3), the period of limitation prescribed for filing objections would commence only from the date when the signed copy of the award is delivered to the party making the application for setting aside the award. If the law prescribes that a copy of the award is to be communicated, delivered, despatched, forwarded, rendered, or sent to the parties concerned in a particular way, and since the law sets a period of limitation for challenging the award in question by the aggrieved party, then the period of limitation can only commence from the date on which the award was received by the concerned party in the manner prescribed by law.

Precedent : The judgment in Tecco Trichy has been recently followed in Anilkumar Jinabhai Patel v. Pravinchandra Jinabhai Patel. (2018) 15 SCC 178.

Precedent : (xii) In State of Himachal Pradesh v Himachal Techno Engineers, (2010) 12 SCC 210. this Court held that if one of the parties to the arbitration is Government, or a statutory body, which has notified holidays, and if the award was delivered to a beldar or a watchman on a holiday or non-working day, it cannot be considered to be "receipt of the award" by the party concerned for the purposes of Section 31(5) of the Act. When the award is delivered, or deposited, or left in the office of a party on a non-working day, the date of physical delivery is not the date of "receipt" of the award by that party. For the purposes of Section 31(5), the date of receipt will have to be the next working day.

Precedent : In Union of India v. Popular Construction, (2001) 8 SCC 470. this Court held that Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963 would not apply to applications filed under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act. It was held that :

Union of India, (2019) 12 SCC 455. this Court held that the phrase "but not thereafter" provided under Section 34(3) of the Act makes it evident that the statutory period of limitation for filing an application for setting aside is three months, which is extendable by thirty days, if sufficient cause is made out. No further period of time can be granted for the filing of an application under Section 34.

Precedent : This Court in P. Radha Bai v. P. Ashok Kumar, (2019) 13 SCC 445 held that :

Precedent : (e) In Ssangyong Engineering & Construction Co. Ltd v. NHAI, (2019) 15 SCC 131 this Court upheld the view taken in the dissenting opinion to be the correct position in law. In this case, the Court was hearing a special leave petition from an order passed by a division bench of the Delhi High Court. This Court noted that:

Precedent : "12. A Section 34 petition which was filed by the appellant was rejected by the learned Single Judge of the Delhi High Court, by a judgment and order dated 9-8-2016 [Ssangyong Engg. and Construction Co. Ltd. v. NHAI, 2016 SCC OnLine Del 4536], in which it was held that a possible view was taken by the majority arbitrators which, therefore, could not be interfered with, given the parameters of challenge to arbitral awards. The learned Single Judge also went on to hold that the New Series published by the Ministry could be applied in the case of the appellant as the base indices for 2004-2005 under the New Series were available. Having so held, the learned Single Judge stated that even though the view expressed in the dissenting award is more appealing, and that he preferred that view, yet he found that since the majority award is a possible view, the scope of interference being limited, the Section 34 petition was dismissed. A Section 37 appeal to the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court yielded the same result, by the impugned judgment dated 3-4-2017 [Ssangyong Engg. and Construction Co. Ltd. v. NHAI, 2017 SCC OnLine Del 7864 : (2017) 240 DLT 711]."

Precedent : "77. The judgments of the Single Judge [Ssangyong Engg. and Construction Co. Ltd. v. NHAI, 2016 SCC OnLine Del 4536] and of the Division Bench [Ssangyong Engg. and Construction Co. Ltd. v. NHAI, 2017 SCC OnLine Del 7864 : (2017) 240 DLT 711] of the Delhi High Court are set aside. Consequently, the majority award is also set aside. Under the scheme of Section 34 of the 1996 Act, the disputes that were decided by the majority award would have to be referred afresh to another arbitration. This would cause considerable delay and be contrary to one of the important objectives of the 1996 Act, namely, speedy resolution of disputes by the arbitral process under the Act. Therefore, in order to do complete justice between the parties, invoking our power under Article 142 of the Constitution of India, and given the fact that there is a minority award which awards the appellant its claim based upon the formula mentioned in the agreement between the parties, we uphold the minority award, and state that it is this award, together with interest, that will now be executed between the parties. The minority award, in paras 11 and 12, states as follows:

Precedent : In McDermott International Inc. v. Burn Standard Co. Ltd., this Court held as under :
