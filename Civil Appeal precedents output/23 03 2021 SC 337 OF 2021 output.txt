Awas Evam Vikash Parishad & Anr.First Appeal No. 827 of 2000 decided on 28.10.2015 arising against the award of the Reference Court dated 23.5.2000 filed by the land owners in respect of land situated in Village Jhandapur was initially dismissed by the High Court on 16.12.2015.

Precedent : 10. In Asha Ram & Anr. v. U.P. Awas Evam Vikas Parishad & Anr.First Appeal No. 552 of 2001 decided on 16.12.2015, the above order of the High Court was taken as the basis to determine the market value of land acquired in the said appeal. Another appeal by the land owners Asha Ram & Anr. v. U.P. Awas Evam Vikas Parishad & Anr.First Appeal No. 412 of 2001 decided on 1.3.2016 was decided on 01.03.2016, relying upon the earlier two orders.

Precedent : Learned counsel for the parties have filed certain documents along with the Special Leave Petitions. The said documents are taken on record, particularly the decision of this Court in SLP(C) Nos.1506-1517/2016, titled as Pradeep Kapoor vs. State of U.P. documents were not on record before the High Court. They are taken on record. These appeals are remitted back to the High Court for deciding afresh. A prayer is made for consideration of the aforesaid documents. It is open to the parties if they so desire to adduce additional evidence, in that event, the High Court may ask Reference Court to record additional evidence and to record finding and then High Court may decide the appeals afresh.

Precedent : "Accordingly, we find that all the appellants in both the sets of first appeals are entitled to compensation at the rate of Rs. 297/- per square yard. We have mentioned in detail regarding the other similar cases where compensation has been awarded at the rate of Rs. 297/- per square yard even though there were gaps between the different notifications, but the villages are same. As discussed above, Narendra (supra) lays emphasis on fair compensation and on parity of compensation in respect of similarly situated land. A careful analysis of the said judgment clearly shows that gaps of a few years in the notifications have been ignored by the Supreme Court and this Court also in the subsequent judgment in First Appeal No. 522 of 2009, Pradeep Kumar v. State of U.P., which has been affirmed by the Supreme Court. We do not find any reason for not awarding compensation at the same rate. Accordingly, the orders of the Reference Court dated 13th April, 1998, 18th February, 2000, 23rd May, 2000, 29th March, 2001 and 02nd April, 2002, which are under challenge in the respective appeals, are set aside. The appellants are entitled to compensation of the land at the rate of Rs. 297/- per square yard along with other statutory benefits under the law which shall be calculated and paid to them expeditiously within six months from today."

Precedent : 15. In another matter referred by the High Court, Pradeep Kumar v. State of U.P.

Precedent : 21. A three Judge Bench of this Court Smt. Tribeni Devi & Ors. v. Collector of Ranchi and Vice Versa, (1972) 1 SCC 480 indicated methods of valuation to be adopted to ascertain the market value of land on the date of the notification under Section 4(1) as: (i) opinion of experts, (ii) the price paid within a reasonable time in bona fide transactions of purchase of the lands acquired or the lands adjacent to the lands acquired and possessing similar advantages; and (iii) a number of years' purchase of the actual or immediately prospective profits of the lands acquired.

Precedent : 22. This Court Gujarat Industrial Development Corpn. v. Narottambhai Morarbhai & Anr., (1996) 11 SCC 159 held that the acid test which the court should always adopt in determining the market value in matters of compulsory acquisition is to eschew feats of imagination and sit in the armchair of a prudent willing purchaser. It was held as under:

Precedent : 23. This Court Land Acquisition Officer v. B. Vijender Reddy & Ors., (2001) 10 SCC 669 has also held that in fixation of rate of compensation under the Land Acquisition Act, there is always some element of guesswork but that has to spring from the totality of evidence, the pattern of rate, the pattern of escalation and escalation of price in the years preceding and succeeding the notification under Section 4 of the LA Act. The Court has held that:

Precedent : 24. Further, this Court Viluben Jhalejar Contractor (Dead) by LRs. v. State of Gujarat, (2005) 4 SCC 789 has held that for determining the market value of the land under acquisition, suitable adjustments have to be made while considering the various positive and negative factors. The following observations have been made-

Precedent : 25. This Court General Manager, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited v. Rameshbhai Jivanbhai Patel & Anr., (2008) 14 SCC 745 has delineated the following factors responsible for increase in land prices such as situation of the land, nature of development in surrounding area, availability of land for development in the area, and demand for the land in the area.

Precedent : 26. The relationship between the market value of land and its potentiality has also been discussed by this Court Atma Singh (Dead) through LRs & Ors. v. State of Haryana & Anr., (2008) 2 SCC 568 wherein it was observed that-

Precedent : "13. One other important factor which also should be borne in mind is that it may not be safe to rely only on an award involving a neighbouring area irrespective of the nature and quality of the land. For determination of market value again, the positive and negative factors germane therefor should be taken into consideration as laid down by this Court in Viluben Jhalejar Contractor v. State of Gujarat [(2005) 4 SCC 789], namely: (SCC p. 797, para 20)..."

Precedent : 30. The record in the present matter does not suggest that there were large scale development activities. The evidence is rather of sale of small areas. There is nothing on record as to when the industrial units were set up and what was the cost of land. Furthermore, there are no sale instances of land situated in Village Makanpur prior to date of notification i.e. 26.6.1982. The sale instances produced by the land owners pertain to Village Sahibabad and Jhandapur which are at a distance of about 3.5 kms from Delhi border. This Court Mohammad Raofuddin v. Land Acquisition Officer, (2009) 14 SCC 367 while dealing with comparable sale instances has held that-

Precedent : 31. The sale instances of a smaller area have to be considered while keeping in view the principle that where a large area is the subject matter of acquisition, suitable deduction is required to be made as no prudent purchaser would purchase large extent of land on the basis of sale of a small extent in the open market. The Court thus has to consider whether the willing vendee would offer the rate at which the trial court proposes to determine the compensation. This Court has even provided for 50% deduction for development charges on the price mentioned in the sale deed. Himmat Singh & Ors. v. State of Madhya Pradesh & Anr., (2013) 16 SCC 392
