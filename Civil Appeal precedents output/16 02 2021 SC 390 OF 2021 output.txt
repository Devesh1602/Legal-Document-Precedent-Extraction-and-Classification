Precedent : 10. Learned senior counsel also relied upon the two judgments of the Madras High Court in Sharanya Balaji Nadar v. The Dental Council of India W.P.Nos.32099/2019 & WMP 32352 & 32353/2019 dated 14.07.2020 and Kashvi Udhaya-kumar v. Union of India WP Nos. 16529 & 16534/2020 & WMP 20510, 20512, 20517 and 20515/2020 dated 01.12.2020 in support of the submission that the interpretation placed by the High Court on Regulation 4(2) is correct. He emphasised that each of the sub-clauses, i.e. (a) to (f) of Clause 4(2) are independent of each other and in the present cases, the declaration of equivalence established by the certificate of 23.12.2020 by the Telangana State Board of Intermediate Education could not have been discredited as was done by the University.

Precedent : 21. The stipulation of equivalence in Regulation 4(2)(f) is not merely a formal one. The provision must be read in the context of the consistent conditions of eligibility prescribed in Regulations 4(2)(a) to (e), as noted above. This court, in State of Bombay v. R.M.D. Chamarbaugwala 1957 SCR 930. interpreted the definition of a 'prize competition' Under s. 2(1)(d) of the Bombay Lotteries and Prize Competitions Control and Tax Act, 1948. A prize competition was defined as including crossword prize competitions, picture prize competitions, etc., and finally, any other prize competition, for which solution is or is not prepared beforehand by the promotors, or for which the solution is determined by lot or chance. This last qualification was appended only to the last sub-clause on 'any other competition'. The court held that the qualification should be equally applicable to the other sub-clauses too, and that there was no difficulty in reading the qualifying clause as lending colour to each of those items. In the present case, Regulation 4(2)(f) explicitly refers to the subject matter requirement reiterated in all the eligibility conditions from (a) to (e); the substance of the eligibility requirement indeed, is that the candidate should have qual-ified an intermediate level examination or first year of a graduate course, and studied the subjects of Physics, Chemistry and Biology at this level, along with practical testing in these subject areas, and the English language. This subject matter requirement is at the heart of eligibility to be admitted into the medical course.
