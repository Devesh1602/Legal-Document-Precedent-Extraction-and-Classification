Statute : 56. In 2005, in Smith v. City of Jackson 544 US 228 (2005), the US Supreme Court construed statutory language in The Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 1967 which proscribed actions which "otherwise adversely affect" an employee. This was read to include disparate impact liability. The Court held that this phrase "focuses on the effects of the action on the employee rather than the motivation for the action of the employer."
