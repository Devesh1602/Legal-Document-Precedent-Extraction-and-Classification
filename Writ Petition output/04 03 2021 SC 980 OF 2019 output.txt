Statute : 1. These writ petitions under Article 32 of the Constitution of India seek a declaration that Section 12(2)(c) of the Maharashtra Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samitis Act, 1961 for short, "the 1961 Act", is ultra vires the provisions of Articles 243D and 243T including Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India. In addition, the validity of the notifications dated 27.7.2018 and 14.2.2020 issued by the State Election Commission, Maharashtra providing for reservation exceeding 50 per cent in respect of Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samitis of districts Washim, Akola, Nagpur and Bhandara have been questioned and it is prayed that the same be quashed and set aside. A district wise chart has been presented to illustrate the excess reserved percentage and seats (more than aggregate 50 per cent of total seats), in some of the districts, which reads thus: "District: Washim

Statute : 3. The provision in the form of Section 12 of the 1961 Act enables the respondents to reserve 27 per cent of seats in the concerned Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samitis. Section 12 of the 1961 Act is reproduced hereunder:

Legislation : 61. It is also incumbent upon the executive to ensure that reservation policies are reviewed from time to time so as to guard against overbreadth. In respect of the objections against the Karnataka Panchayat Raj Act, 1993, all that we can refer to is the Chinnappa Reddy Commission Report (1990) which reflects the position as it existed twenty years ago. In the absence of updated empirical data, it is well-nigh impossible for the courts to decide whether the reservations in favour of OBC groups are proportionate or not.

Statute : 13. As regards Section 12(2)(c) of the 1961 Act inserted in 1994, the plain language does give an impression that uniform and rigid quantum of 27 per cent of the total seats across the State need to be set apart by way of reservation in favour of OBCs. In light of the dictum of the Constitution Bench, such a rigid provision cannot be sustained much less having uniform application to all the local bodies within the State. Instead, contemporaneous empirical inquiry must be undertaken to identify the quantum qua local body or local body specific.

Statute : 17. In light of the finding recorded hitherto (that no inquiry much less contemporaneous rigorous empirical inquiry into the nature and implications of backwardness by a dedicate Commission established by the State for the purpose has been undertaken), it is not open to the State to fall back on Section 12(2)(c) as enacted in 1994. That provision, as aforementioned, is an enabling provision and would become functional and operational only upon fulfilling triple test as specified by the Constitution Bench of this Court. That is the sine qua non or the quintessence for exercise of power to reserve seats for OBCs in the local bodies. Indeed, the exercise of power to reserve seats for OBCs springs from Section 12(2)(c) of the 1961 Act, but that is hedged by conditions and limitations specified by the Constitution Bench of this Court and would not get ignited until such time.

Statute : 24. The State Election Commission had invited our attention to the fact that, provision similar to Section 12(2)(c) of the 1961 Act regarding reservation for OBCs finds place in other State enactments (1) The Maharashtra Village Panchayats Act, 1959 - Section 10(2)(c)

Statute : (2) Maharashtra Municipal Councils, Nagar Panchayats and Industrial Townships Act, 1965 - Sections 9(2)(d) and 341(B)(4)

Statute : (3) The Maharashtra Municipal Corporations Act, 1949 - Section 5A(1)(c) concerning the establishment of Village Panchayat, Municipal Council, Nagar Panchayat, Corporation, etc. Needless to observe that the view taken in this judgment would apply with full force to the interpretation and application of the provisions of the stated Act(s) and the State Authorities must immediately move into action to take corrective and follow up measures in right earnest including to ensure that future elections to the concerned local bodies are conducted strictly in conformity with the exposition of this Court in K. Krishna Murthy (supra), for providing reservation in favour of OBCs.

Statute : 25. In conclusion, we hold that Section 12(2)(c) of the 1961 Act is an enabling provision and needs to be read down to mean that it may be invoked only upon complying with the triple conditions (mentioned in paragraph 12 above) as specified by the Constitution Bench of this Court, before notifying the seats as reserved for OBC category in the concerned local bodies. Further, we quash and set aside the impugned notifications to the extent they provide for reservation of seats for OBCs being void and non est in law including the follow up actions taken on that basis. In other words, election results of OBC candidates which had been made subject to the outcome of these writ petitions including so notified in the concerned election programme issued by the State Election Commission, are declared as non est in law and the vacancy of seat(s) caused on account of this declaration be forthwith filled up by the State Election Commission with general/open candidate(s) for the remainder term of the concerned local bodies, by issuing notification in that regard.

Statute : 28. Accordingly, these writ petitions must partly succeed. The challenge to the validity of Section 12(2)(c) of the 1961 Act is negatived. Instead, that provision is being read down to mean that reservation in favour of OBCs in the concerned local bodies can be notified to the extent that it does not exceed aggregate 50 per cent of the total seats reserved in favour of SCs/STs/OBCs taken together. In other words, the expression "shall be" preceding 27 per cent occurring in Section 12(2)(c), be construed as "may be" including to mean that reservation for OBCs may be up to 27 per cent but subject to the outer limit of 50 per cent aggregate in favour of SCs/STs/OBCs taken together, as enunciated by the Constitution Bench of this Court. However, the impugned notifications/orders dated 27.7.2018 and 14.2.2020 and all other similar notifications issued by the State Election Commission during the pendency of these writ petitions mentioning that the elections to the concerned local bodies were being held subject to the outcome of these writ petitions, are quashed and set aside to the extent of providing reservation of seats in the concerned local bodies for OBCs. As a consequence, follow up steps taken on the basis of such notifications including the declaration of results of the candidates against the reserved OBC seats in the concerned local bodies, are declared non est in law; and the seats are deemed to have been vacated forthwith prospectively by the concerned candidate(s) in terms of this judgment. The State Election Commission shall take immediate steps to announce elections in respect of such vacated seats, of the concerned local bodies, not later than two weeks from today, to be filled by general/open category candidates for the remainder term of the Panchayat/Samitis. Ordered accordingly.
