30. Learned  Senior  Counsel  submitted,  that  even

after  submission  of  the  revised  plan,  KIAL  did  not  hear

anythingfromRPandthereforevideemaildated10.2.2019,

thattheresolutionplanssubmittedaftertheduedatealso

submit  a  revised  bid,  which  was  submitted  by  it  on

12.2.2019.Learnedcounselthereforesubmitted,thatitis

clear  from  the  record,  that  KIAL  had  objected  to  the

participationofKalprajattheearliestpossibleopportunity

i.e.on29.1.2019.Notonlythat,thereafterKIALcontinued

alone  it  had  to  face  the  risk  of  being  ousted  from

consideration.   It  is  therefore  submitted,  that  the

contention,thatKIALhasacquiescedtotheparticipationof

Kalpraj  and  was  therefore  estopped  from  challenging  its

participationiswithoutany substance. Learnedcounsel

submitted,  that  the  contention,  that  KIAL  was  taking

chances  is  also  totally  incorrect.   It  had  objected  to  the

participation  of  Kalpraj  at  the  very  first  opportunity  and

continued  to  object  till CoC approved  its  plan  and  also

thereafter,bywayofanapplicationbeforeNCLTobjectingto

theapprovaloftheResolutionPlanofKalpraj.
31. Learned  counsel  further  submitted,  that  the

contention,thatKIALisasubsidiaryofKotakBankand

thatKotakBankhadalsonotobjectedtoKalprajsubmitting

its  Resolution  Plan  and  therefore  the  same  amounted  to

acquiescenceisalsonotcorrect.Hesubmitted,thatfirstly,

inthereplyfiledbyRPtotheapplicationfiledbyKIALin

NCLT, there  is  no  plea  regarding  the  Kotak  Bank's

32. On  merits,  Shri  Kaul  would  submit,  that  the

entireprocessadoptedbyRPandCoCwascontrarytothe

statutory  provisions,  fair  play  and  transparency.   He

submitted,thatperusalofthedefinitionof'applicant'inthe

resolution  applicant.   He  submitted,  that  the  entire

the  plan  was  submitted  by  KIAL  there  was  a  detailed

discussionwithRPwithregardtotheplansubmittedbyit,

whereinentireplanwasdisclosed,afterwhichKalprajwas

Kalpraj  is  almost  identical  with  the  Resolution  Plan 38

the  difference  between  exclusion  of  a

that  the  appellants  were  sure  that
keepingin viewtheirpast conduct,the
Bombay  High  Court  may  not  interfere
withtheorderoftheAppellateTribunal.
Therefore,theytookachancebeforethe
Delhi  High  Court  and  succeeded  in
persuading  the  learned  Single  Judge  of
the  Court  to  entertain  their  prayer  for
stay  of  further  proceedings  before  the

which  the  learned  Senior  Counsel
appearing  for  the  appellant,  Kartik  K.
Parekh  made  a  statement  before  the
DelhiHighCourton7112007thatthe

the  Delhi  High  Court on the  ground  of

confirmedanditwasobservedthatthe
parties cannot be  allowed  toindulge  in

surprised  us  that  after  having  made  a
prayer  that  the  writ  petitions  filed  by
thembetreatedasappealsunderSection

applications  for  recall  of  that  order.  No
doubt,thelearnedSingleJudgeaccepted
their  prayer  and  the  Division  Bench
confirmedtheorderofthelearnedSingle
Judge  but  the  manner  in  which  the
appellants  prosecuted  the  writ  petitions
before  the  Delhi  High  Court  leaves  no
room  for  doubt  that  they  had  done  so
with  the  sole  object  of  delaying

(SCCp.65,paras1415)
        "14.Inordertoconstitutewaiver,
    there  must  be  voluntary  and

                in  mind  that  acquiescence,  being  a

112. Thus,forconstitutingacquiescenceorwaiverit

                stated  earlier,  in  the  letter  of
                repudiation,  it  only  stated  that  the

                falling  under  the  purview  of  transit

                the  plea  that  the  claim  was  not

The  last  of  such  Form  'G'  was  issued  on  11.12.2018,

accordingtowhichthelastdateforsubmissionofresolution

planwas8.1.2019. KIALsubmitteditsresolutionplanon

8.1.2019. Subsequently,Kalprajsubmitteditsresolution

planon27.1.2019.
117. On KIAL coming  to  know  about  the  same,  on

29.1.2019  itself,  it  had  sent  an  email  protesting  to  RP

against  acceptance  of  belated  resolution  plan  of  Kalpraj.

Thesaidemaildated29.1.2019sentby KIAL toRPreads

thus:

                "Asyouareaware,thatthelastdate
                for  submission  of  the  bids  for  Ricoh
                IndiaLimited,undertheCIRPwas8th
                January,2019.Consequently,weduly
                submitted  our  bid  (along  with  the
                requisite Bid Bond  Guarantee) within
                thesaidtime. However,wearegiven
                to  understand  that  you  have  been
                receivingandacceptingthebidseven
                afterthesaiddate,whennoextension
                oftime(filingofForm'G')wasnotified.

                Thisseverelyjeopardisesour position
                and isagainstthe spiritofthecode, 116

                especially  when  our  Resolution  Plan
                was  opened  immediately  (along  with
                the  commercials)  and  subsequently,
                evendiscussedatlengthinthemeeting
                of  15th January,  2019,  which  was
                attendedbyvariousstakeholders.

                Inthislight,wewouldrequestyouto
                sharewithustherequisitenotification
                (FormG)towardsextensionoftimefor
                bid  submission  at  the  earliest.
                However,  in  the  event,  such  a
                notification  has  not  been  made,  it
                would  only  be  logical  that  all  plans
                submitted  after  8th January,  2019
                shouldbeheldinvalid,moresowhen

                Welookforwardtoyourconfirmation
                ontheabove."

118. It  could  therefore  be  seen,  that  immediately

withinadayofthesubmissionoftheplanbyKalpraj,KIAL

objectedtotheacceptanceofitsplanafter8.1.2019,when

no  extension  of  time  for  the  same  was  notified.   It  is

specifically  stated,  that  the  said  severely  jeopardized  its

positionandwasagainstthespiritoftheCode,especially

whenKIAL'sresolutionplanwasopenedimmediatelyand

discussedatlengthwithvariousstakeholders. KIAL has

therefore  requested  for  sharing  the  requisite  information 117

providingforextensionoftimeforbidsubmission. Itis

furtherstated,thatintheeventnosuchnotificationwas

issued,allplanssubmittedafter8.1.2019shouldbeheldto

beinvalid.
119. AfterthesaidemailwasaddressedbyKIALtoRP,

itreceivedanemailfromRPon30.1.2019. Itisstatedin

the  said  email  dated  30.1.2019,  that  subsequent  to  the

resolutionplansubmittedon8.1.2019,CoC'srepresentative

and  RP  had  a  detailed  discussion  with  its  team  on  the

changesrequiredtobemadeintheresolutionplan.Vide

the  said  email  dated  30.1.2019,  KIAL  was  requested  to

submittheamendedresolutionplanby3p.m.on1.2.2019.

On1.2.2019,leftwithnochoice,KIALsubmitteditsrevised

resolutionplan.
120. On  10.2.2019, KIAL sent  another  email  to  RP,

whichreadsthus:

                "Ithasbeenquitesometime,sincewe
                sought  from  you  on  your  decision  to

thatthiswasinthespiritofvaluemaximisationofassetsof

123. It  is  in  dispute,  as  to  whether  RP  had  again

directed  KIAL  and  Kalpraj  vide  email  dated  11.2.2019  to
