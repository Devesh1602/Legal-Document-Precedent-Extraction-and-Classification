ontherepaymentoftermloans,initiallyforaperiodofthree

monthsandfurtherextendedbyanotherthreemonths,which

cametoanendon31.08.2020.Theavowedobjectofallowing

such  a  moratorium  was  to  ease  the  financial  stress  that  was

beingfacedbyborrowers"byrelaxingrepaymentpressuresand

improving  access  to  working  capital".   Such  measures  would

benefitthosewhosebusinesswasotherwisesoundbutbecame

victimsoftheeconomicmeltdowncausedbythepandemic. In

the caseofindividualborrowershavingpersonal accounts,an

entirely  different  approach  was  called  for  and  this  was  finally

addressedbythegovernmentinthepackageannouncedbyit.It

issubmittedthaton6.8.2020the RBIannounced"Resolution

there  cannot  be  a  single  formula  applied  to  all  loans  and  to

different  sectors.   The  Kamath  Committee  therefore  evolved

normswhichrelaxedtheexistingnormsonwhichrestructuring

ofloansweretobeaffected.

           Itissubmittedthatforthepurposesofrestructuringalone,

the  fundamental  premise  was  that  the  business  is  viable  and

31. Now  so  far  as  the  charging  of  penal  interest/interest  on

interest/compound  interest  during  the  moratorium  period  is

concerned,itstandsabsolutelyonadifferentfooting. Atthis

stage,  it  is  required  to  be  noted  that  in  fact  the  Central

Governmenthascomeoutwithapolicydecisionsubsequentlyby

whichitisdecidednottochargetheinterestoninterestonthe

loansuptoRs.2crores.However,suchreliefisrestrictedtothe

followingcategories:

     (i) MSMEloansuptoRs.2crore

     (ii) EducationloansuptoRs.2crore

     (iii) HousingloansuptoRs.2crore

     (iv) ConsumerdurableloansuptoRs.2crore

     (v) CreditcardduesuptoRs.2crore

     (vi) AutoloansuptoRs.2crore

     (vii) PersonalloanstoprofessionalsuptoRs.2crore

     (viii) ConsumptionloansuptoRs.2crore

     There  is  no  justification  shown  to  restrict  the  relief  of  not

charginginterestoninterestwithrespecttotheloansuptoRs.2

croresonlyandthattoorestrictedtothe aforesaidcategories.

What  are  the  basis  to  restrict  it  to  Rs.  2  crores  are  not
forthcoming. Therefore,assuch,thereisnorationaltorestrict

suchreliefwithrespecttoloansuptoRs.2croresonly. Even

otherwise,  it  is  required  to  be  noted  that  the  scheme  dated

23.10.2020  granting  relief/benefit  of  waiver  of  compound

interest/interest  on  interest  contains  eligibility  criteria  and  it

providesthatanyborrowerwhoseaggregateofallfacilitieswith

lendinginstitutionismorethanRs.2crores(sanctionedlimitor

outstanding  amount)  will  not be eligible  for  exgratia payment

underthesaidscheme. Therefore,ifthetotalexposureofthe

loanatthegrantofthesanctionismorethanRs.2crores,the

borrowerwillbeineligibleirrespectiveoftheactualoutstanding.

ForExample,iftheborrowerhasbeensanctionedaloanofRs.5
