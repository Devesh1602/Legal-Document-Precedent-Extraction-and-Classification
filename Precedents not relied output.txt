PRE_NOT_RELIED : In Rishipal Singh vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and another14 this Court observed:- "13.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : What emerges from the above judgments is that when a prosecution at the initial stage is asked to be quashed, the test to be applied by the court is as to whether the uncontroverted allegations as made in the complaint prima facie establish the case.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : The courts have to see whether the continuation of the complaint amounts to abuse of process of law and whether continuation of the criminal proceeding results in miscarriage of justice or when the court comes to a conclusion that quashing these proceedings would otherwise serve the ends of justice, then the court can exercise the power under Section 482 CrPC.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : While exercising the power under the provision, the courts have to only look at the uncontroverted allegation in the complaint whether prima facie discloses an offence or not, but it should not convert itself to that of a trial court and dwell into the disputed questions of fact."
 14 (2014) 7 SCC 215 18 This decision thus dealt with the parameters which ought to be considered while entertaining an application under Section 482 of the Code and is not a decision directly on the point.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : The decision in Anil Kumar Bose vs. State of Bihar15 pertained to a case which had arisen after a full fledged trial, where, as regards offence punishable under Section 420/34 IPC, it was observed that the essential ingredient being mens rea, mere failure on part of the concerned employees to perform their duties or to observe the rules/procedure may be administrative lapses but could not be said to be enough to attract the penal provisions under Section 420 IPC.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : The matter was considered after the facts had crystalized in the form of evidence before the court and as such, this decision is of no relevance for the present purposes.

(for himself, Shah, Sikri, Shelat and Vaidyalingam, JJ.) had held that Article 368 only provided the procedure for the amendment of the Constitution, but that the power to amend the Constitution was to be found in the residuary power conferred on Parliament by Articles 245 and 246(1) read with Entry 97 List I and by Article 248.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : 
 11. Similarly, the judgment of the Division Bench of Kerala High Court in the case of T.P.FINIMOLE vs. ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER (AA), COMMERCIAL TAXES AND ANOTHER  (2009) 24 VST 385 is also not apposite to the facts of the present case.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : In support of that contention of his he sought to take assistance from the decision of the Judicial Committee in Gokulchand Dwarkadas Morarka v. The King(2) and Madan Mohan Singh v. The State of U.P.(3).

PRE_NOT_RELIED : Both those decisions deal with the question of the validity of sanctions given for the institution of certain criminal proceedings.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : The provisions under which sanction was sought in those cases required the sanctioning authority to apply its mind and find out whether there was any justification for instituting the prosecutions.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : The Judicial Committee as well as this Court has laid down that in such cases, the court must be satisfied either from the order of sanction or from the other evidence that all the relevant facts had been placed before the sanctioning authority and that authority had granted the sanction after applying its mind to those facts.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : The decision in Popatbhai's case (supra) no where says so.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : All that it says is that, ordinarily, the Police should be approached first; and this approaching of police is meant to be approaching the Inspector of Police of the concerned Police Station with a report of commission of a cognizable offence.


Id : 4259
PRE_NOT_RELIED : He relies upon a decision of the Privy Council in Lemm v. Mitchell (1), Eyre v. Wynn-Mackenzie (2) and Butcher v. Henderson (3) in support of his proposition.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : The last two cases have no bearing upon this matter; but strong reliance is placed upon the Privy Council case.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : In that case, the earlier, action which had been commenced when the Ordinance had abrogated the right of action for criminal conversation, had already ended in favour of the defendant and no appeal therefrom was pending, and it was held that the revival of the right of action for criminal conversation did not invest the plaintiff with a right to begin an action again and thus expose the defendant to a double jeopardy for the same act, unless the statute expressly and by definite words gave him that right.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : The Privy Council case is thus entirely different.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : In Phulbari Tea Estate v. Its Workmen,(1) this Court has held that even if a domestic enquiry is found to be defective, the employer may seek to justify the dismissal of his employee by leading evidence before the Tribunal to which an industrial dispute arising out of the impugned dismissal has been referred for adjudication.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : The decision in the case of Phulbari Tea Estate (supra) proceeds on the basis which is of basic importance in industrial adjudication that findings properly recorded in (1) [1960] 1 S.C.R. 32.domestic enquiries which are conducted fairly, cannot be re- examined by Industrial adjudication unless the said findings are either perverse, or are not supported by any evidence, or some other valid reason 'of that character.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : In such a case, the fact that the finding is not accepted by the Industrial Tribunal would not necessarily preclude the employee from justifying the dismissal of his employee on the merits, provided, of course, he leads evidence before the Industrial Tribunal and persuades the Tribunal to accept his case.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : The said judgment of Centum (supra) was held in a different context, wherein the issue was failure to claim input tax credit in the tax periods in which purchases were effected and the claim made in the subsequent periods.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : , observed as follows :- "Section 106 of the Evidence Act cannot be construed to mean that the accused has by reason of the circumstance that the facts are especially within his own knowledge to prove that he has not committed the offence.

The High Court however strongly relied on two decisions, namely, the decision of the Madras High Court in the case of The Collector of Central Excise, Madras v. K. Palappa Nadar(1) and (1) A.I.R. 1964 Mad. 111.of the Gujarat High Court in the case of The Marsden Spg.
and Co. Ltd. v. Shri L. V. Pol, Superintendent of Central Excise (Tax)

PRE_NOT_RELIED : In the Madras case (supra) the order impugned ran as follows "Having regard to all the circumstances of the case, the Central Board of Revenue hereby directs, without prejudice to the merits of the case, [italics (here in ') ours] the order dated 3rd March, 1956 passed by the Collector of Central Excise, Madras shall be vacated".
                         The High Court while interpreting the order observed as follows "After careful consideration of the arguments of the learned Advocate General for the appellant and also of the respondent, we are of the opinion that, in the absence of any specific words in the order of the Central Board of Revenue, it is not possible to spell out from its terms a precise direction for a de novo enquiry, giving jurisdiction to the Collector, for that purpose".

PRE_NOT_RELIED : The case of The Marsden Spg. & Co. Ltd. (supra) is also clearly distinguishable.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : We do not agree with the view expressed by the Pune ITAT SMC in the case of Bhagani Nivedita Sahakari Bank Ltd(supra) when it says that co-operative society as mentioned in CL.(v) is a general species, whereas the other five categories of co-operative societies which are specifically referred to in other provisions are specific co-operative societies.

PRE_NOT_RELIED :  The further conclusion in the said decision that the term `co-operative society' in CL.(v) of S.194A(3) has to be interpreted as co-operative society other than co-operative bank, is again unsustainable.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : In the case decided by ITAT Panaji Bench in ITA No.85/PN/2013 for AY.09-10 in the case of the Bailhongal Uraban Co-op Bank Ltd Vs. JCIT order dated 28.08.2013, the Tribunal proceeded on the footing that the aforesaid Circular has been quashed by the Hon'ble Bombay High Court in the case of The Jalgaon District Central Co-Operative Bank Ltd. Vs. Union of India 265 ITR 423(Bom) and therefore choose to follow the decision rendered by Pune ITAT SMC in the case of Bhagani Nivedita Sahakari Bank Ltd(supra)

PRE_NOT_RELIED : . In our view the Hon'ble Bombay High Court in the case of Jalgaon District Central Co-Operative Bank Ltds case was dealing with a case of challenge to para 3 of CBDT Circular No.9 dated: 11.09.2002 which tried to interpret the word "member"
as given in Sec.194A(3)(v) of the Act.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : It is only that part of the Circular that had been quashed by the Hon'ble High Court and the other paragraphs of the Circular had no connection with the issue before the Hon'ble Bombay High Court.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : How could it be said that the entire Circular has been quashed by the Hon'ble Bombay High Court?

PRE_NOT_RELIED : In our view para 2 of the Circular still holds good and the conclusion of the ITAT Pune Bench in the case of the Bailhongal Uraban Co-op Bank Ltd(supra) are not factually correct.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : 
Consequently, the conclusions drawn in the aforesaid decision also contrary to facts and hence cannot be considered as precedent.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : This order is questioned on the authority of the decision of this Court in The New Jehangir Vakil Mills Ltd.
v. The Commissioner of Income-tax(1) which, it is claimed, completely covers this case.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : In that case also, the High Court of Bombay had called for a supplemental statement of the case, and it was ruled by this Court that the High Court had exceeded its jurisdiction.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : 
Before dealing with this question, it is necessary to go back a little, and refer briefly to some cases decided earlier than The New Jehangir Vakil Mills case (1) and Jagdish Mills Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income-tax (2), on which reliance has been placed in this case. ID (1) [1960] 1 S.C.R. 249.
(2) [1960] 1 S.C.R. 236.Keshav Mills Co., Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income-tax (1), the High Court of Bombay called for a supplemental statement of the case, but it expressed the view that if a cheque was received by a creditor on a British Indian Bank and he gave the cheque to his bank for collection, the bank must be treated as his agent and that, on the realisation of the amount of the cheque in the taxable territory, the creditor must be regarded as having received it in the taxable territory, even if he was outside it.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : In Sir Sobha Singh v.
Commissioner of Income-tax (2), it was held by the Punjab High Court that where cheques were given to a bank for purposes of collection, the receipt of the money was at the place where the bank on which the cheques were drawn was situated.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : They are Kirloskar Bros. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income-tax (3 ) and Ogale Glass Works Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income-tax (4).

PRE_NOT_RELIED : 
In both these cases, it was held that unless the payee expressly constituted the post office as his agent, the mere posting of the cheque did not constitute the post office the agent of the payee, and that the amount of the cheque was also received at the place where the cheque was received.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : In Kirloskar Bros. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income-tax(3), it was held that the mere posting of the cheque in Delhi was not tantamount to the receipt of the cheque in Delhi, because the payee had not requested the Government to send the cheque by post.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : In Ogale Glass Works case (4), the Bombay High Court asked for a supplementary statement of the case from the Tribunal as to whether there was any express request by the assessee that the cheque should be sent by post, and held that as there was no such express request, the receipt of the money was not where the cheque was posted but at the place where the money was received.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : 
(4) I. Tax Reference No. 10 of 1949 of the Bombay H. C.
decided on September 17, 1951.The last two decisions of the Bombay High Court were reversed by this Court, and it was held that an intimation to the payer " to remit " the amount by cheque was sufficient nomination of the post office as the agent of the payee: vide Commissioner of Income-tax v. Ogale Glass Works Ltd. (1) and Commissioner of Income-tax v. Kirloskar Bros.
Ltd. (2).

PRE_NOT_RELIED : In Kusumben D. Mahadevia v.
Commissioner of Income-tax Bombay (2), it was observed: " In our opinion, the objection of the assessee is well-founded.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : The Tribunal did not address itself to the question whether the Concessions Order applied to the assessee.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : It decided the question of assessability on the short ground that the income had not arisen in Baroda but in British India.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : That aspect of the matter has not been touched by the Bombay High Court.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : The latter has, on the other hand, considered whether the Concessions Order applies to the assessee, a matter not touched by the Tribunal.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : The learned counsel for the appellant relying on the decision of this Court in Rajputana Agencies Ltd., v. Commissioner of Income Tax(1) urged that the same meaning should be attributed to the expression "rate applicable to the total income of the company" in s. 16(2), as was attributed bv this Court to the same expression occurring in sub-clause(b) of clause (ii) to the second explanation to proviso to paragraph B of Part I of the First Schedule to the Indian Finance Act, 1951.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : We are unable to accept this argument

PRE_NOT_RELIED : During the course of the hearing of the connected Civil Appeal in M/s. Maganlal Sankalchand v. The Commissioner of Income Tax, New Delhi(1), the learned counsel (1) Civil Appeal NO. 703 of 1963-judgment delivered on May 8, 1964.for the Commissioner of Income Tax raised two additional arguments.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : First, he urged that the word 'rebate' in s.
16(2) only related to rebate granted under the Indian Finance Act,and not any rebate granted under the Conces- sion Order.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : He further referred us to r. 14 of the Indian Income TaxRules, which prescribes the certificate to be furnished bythe principal officer of a company under s.
20 of the Act.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : The relevant portion of the certificate is as follows : I/We certify:--- (A) (1) that the Company estimates that out of the profits of the said period-- (a) .... per cent., is chargeable a, full Indian rate; (b) per cent.. is chargeable at the reduced rate of . . .

PRE_NOT_RELIED : The observations of the Hon ble Supreme Court in paragraphs 74, 75 and 76 are relevant, they read as under:- 74.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : It is necessary to examine the scheme underlying the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : We are relieved of the need of embarking upon any maiden voyage in this direction in view of the availability of a Constitution  Bench  decision  in M.P.V.Sundararamier & Co. Vs. State of A.P., Venkatarama Aiyar, J., speaking for the Constitution Bench, traced the history of legislations preceding the Constitution, analysed the scheme underlying the division of legislative powers between the Centre and the States and then succinctly summed up the quintessence of the analysis.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : It was held, inter alia: 1.In List I Entries 1 to 81 mention the several matters over which Parliament has authority to legislate.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : Entries 82 to 92 enumerate the taxes which could be imposed by a law of Parliament.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : An examination of these two groups of entries shows that while the main subject of legislation figures in the first group, a tax in relation thereto is separately mentioned in the second.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : 
 2.In list II Entries 1 to 44 form one group mentioning the subjects on which the States could legislate.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : Entries 45 to 63 in that list form another group, and they deal with taxes.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : (AIR p.493, para 51)

PRE_NOT_RELIED : 3.Taxation is not intended to be comprised in the main subject in which it might on an extended construction be regarded as included, but is treated as a distinct matter for purposes of legislative competence.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : And this distinction is also manifest in the language of Article 248 clauses (1) and (2) and of Entry 97 in List I of the Constitution.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : Under the Scheme of the entries in the lists, taxation is regarded as a distinct matter and is separately set out.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : (AIR 494, paras 51 & 55)

PRE_NOT_RELIED : 4.The entries in the legislative lists must be construed broadly and not narrowly or in a pedantic manner.(AIR p.494, para 56)

PRE_NOT_RELIED : 5.The entries in the two lists  Lists I and II must be construed, if possible, so as to avoid conflict.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : Faced with a suggested conflict between entries in List I and List II, what has first to be decided is whether there is any conflict.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : 
 If there is none, the question of application of the non obstante clause subject to does not arise.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : And, if there be conflict, the correct approach to the question is to see whether it was possible to effect a reconciliation between the two entries so a s to avoid a conflict and overlapping.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : 
 Illustration

PRE_NOT_RELIED : If it is possible to construe Entry 42 in List I as not including tax on inter-State sales it should be so construed and the power to levy such tax must be held to be included in Entry 54 in List II (entries as they existed per- Forty-second Amendment, 1976).

PRE_NOT_RELIED :  (See Governor General in Council V. Province of Madras and Province of Madras V. Boddu Paidanna & Sons.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : (AIR p.495, paras 56-57) 6.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : In the event of a dispute arising it should be determined by applying the doctrine of pith and substance to find out whether between two entries assigned to two different legislatures the particular subject of the legislation falls within the ambit of the one or the other.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : Where there is a clear and irreconcilable conflict of jurisdiction between the Centre and a Provincial Legislature it is the law of the Centre that must prevail.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : In view of the law laid down by the Supreme Court in its judgment in the case State of W.B. Vs. Kesoram Industries Ltd. And others referred to above the Parliament cannot be said to have power to impose tax in relation to lotteries under residuary Entry 97 of List I of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : Thus, we find that there is absolutely no substance in the contention that the State legislature did not have competence to legislate the State Act under Entry 62 of List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution.

 The High Court has relied upon the decision of this Court in R.B. Seth Moolchand Suganchand v. Commissioner of Income Tax, New Delhi, [1972] 86 ITR 647, in rejecting the assessee's contention.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : In Suganchand's case the assessee was carrying on a mining business, he had paid a sum of Rs.
1,53,800 to acquire lease of certain areas of land bearing mica for a period of 20 years.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : Those areas had already been worked for 15 years by other lessees.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : The assessee had paid a sum of Rs.3,200 as fee for a licence for prospecting for emerald for a period of one year.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : In addition to the fee, the assessee had to pay royalty on the emerald excavated and sold.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : The assessee claimed the expenditure of Rs.3,200 paid by it as fee to the Government for prospecting licence as revenue expenditure.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : The assessee further claimed that the appropriate part of Rs. 1,53,800 paid by it as lease money was allow-able as revenue expenditure.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : The Court held that while considering the question in relation to the mining leases an empirical test is that where minerals have to be won, extracted and brought to surface by mining operations, the expenditure incurred for acquiring such a right would be of a capital nature.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : But, where the mineral has already been gotten and is on the surface, then the expenditure incurred for obtaining the right to acquire the raw material would be a revenue expenditure.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : The Court held that since the payment of tender money was for acquisition of capital asset, the same could not be treated as a revenue expenditure.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : As regards the claim relating to the prospecting licence 322 fee of Rs.3,200 the Court held that since the licence was for prospecting only and as the assessee had not started working a mine, the payment was made to the Government with the object of initiating the business.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : The Court held that even though the amount of prospecting licence fee was for a period of one year, it did not make any difference as the fee was paid to obtain a licence to investigate, search and find the mineral with the object of conducting the business, extracting ore from the earth necessary for initiating the business.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : 
 In British Insulated and Helsby Cables Ltd. v. Atherton, [1926] AC 205, Lord Cave laid down a test which has almost universely been accepted.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : Lord Cave observed: "... when an expenditure is made, not only once and for all, but with a view to bringing into existence an asset or an advantage for the enduring benefit of a trade, I think that there is very good reason (in the absence of special circum- stances leading to an opposite conclusion) for treating such an expenditure as properly attributable not to revenue out to capital."

PRE_NOT_RELIED : We are, therefore, not in agreement with the opinion expressed by this Court in Sangeet vs. State of Haryana that the deprival of remission power of the appropriate as not permissible is not in consonance with the law and we specifically overrule the same."

PRE_NOT_RELIED : It has to be held that principle enunciated by Their Lordships in the above judgment would not be applicable to the facts and circumstances of the present case for the following reasons: 9.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : In the said case, Unit Trust of India being the Garnishee was issued with a notice and pursuant to said notice money held on behalf of assessee was paid by the Garnishee to the Department.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : A plea was taken by the assessee stating that there was a lock-in period and money deposited by the assessee could not have been withdrawn prematurely without the consent of the depositor or the assessee since the interest benefit was being lost and said plea came to be accepted by the Apex Court, by examining the very scheme itself, it was noticed by their Lordships that scheme guaranteed that capital invested in the scheme will be protected on maturity i.e., units will not be redeemed below par.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : It has been held in the said judgment by Hon'ble Apex Court as under: "12.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : Whether the action on the part of the appellant to act thereupon was valid, is the question.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : The scheme, the relevant provision whereof had been noticed by us hereinbefore, goes to show that the lock-in period was for a period of five years.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : 
        Purchase of the units, however, was allowed from 1st September, 2001 at NAV based repurchase price.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : The scheme constituted a contract between the parties.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : The option of the purchase was to be exercised by the respondent.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : The appellant, on the basis of the said purported notice dated 8.2.2002, could not have placed itself in the shoes of the respondent.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : It is not in dispute that the respondent was a defaulter to the extent of Rs.157.77 lacs.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : He had sold some of his properties in 1998.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : A portion of the sale proceeds, namely, 65 lacs had been invested with the appellant.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : He had sought for exemption under Section 54AE of the Act.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : In support of this submission reference has been made to the decision reported in Ramnath Madho Prasad & Ors.
v. State of Madhya Pradesh, A.I.R. 1953 S.C. 420 wherein it has been observed: "It is settled law that it is not safe to convict and accused merely on the evidence furnished by a dying declaration without further corroboration because such a statement is not made on oath and is not subject to cross-examination and because the maker of it might be mentally and physically in a state of confusion and might be well drawing upon his imagination while he was making the declaration.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : It is in this light that the different dying declaration made by the deceased and sought to be proved in the case have to be considered."


Id : 1757
PRE_NOT_RELIED : The facts of the case and conflicting views expressed in the above two cases has been noticed in Paragraph Nos. 1 and 2, which are to the following effect:- "In this criminal appeal, the conviction of the accused-appellant is based upon the dying declaration of the deceased which was recorded by the Judicial Magistrate (PW 4).

PRE_NOT_RELIED : The learned Sessions Judge as well as the High Court held the dying declaration made by the deceased to be truthful, voluntary and trustworthy.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : The Magistrate in his evidence had stated that he had contacted the patient through the medical officer on duty and after putting some ques- tions to the patient to find out whether she was able to make the statement; whether she was set on fire; whether she was conscious and able to make the statement and on being satis- fied he recorded the statement of the de- ceased.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : There was a certificate of the doctor which indicates that the patient was con- scious.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : The High Court on consideration of the evidence of the Magistrate as well as on the certificate of the doctor on the dying decla- ration recorded by the Magistrate together with other circumstances on record came to the conclusion that the deceased Chandrakala was physically and mentally fit and as such the dying declaration can be relied upon.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : When the appeal against the judgment of the Aurangabad Bench of the Bombay High Court was placed be- fore a three-Judge Bench of this Court, the counsel for the appellant relied upon the de- cision of this Court in the case of Paparam- baka Rosamma v. State of A.P., (1999) 7 SCC 695 and contended that since the certification of the doctor was not to the effect that the patient was in a fit state of mind to make the statement, the dying declaration could not have been accepted by the Court to form the sole basis of conviction.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : On behalf of the counsel appearing for the State another three- Judge Bench decision of this Court in the case of Koli Chunilal Savji v. State of Gujarat (1999) 9 SCCC 562 was relied upon wherein this Court has held that if the materials on record indicate that the deceased was fully conscious and was capable of making a statement, the dy- ing declaration of the deceased thus recorded cannot be ignored merely because the doctor had not made the endorsement that the deceased was in a fit state of mind to make the state- ment in question.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : Since the two aforesaid de- cisions expressed by two Benches of three learned Judges was somewhat contradictory the Bench by order dated 27-7-2002 referred the question to the Constitution Bench.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : 
 2. At the outset we make it clear that we are only resolving the so-called conflict be- tween the aforesaid three-Judge Bench decision of this Court, whereafter the criminal appeal will be placed before the Bench presided over by Justice M.B. Shah who had referred the mat- ter to the Constitution Bench.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : We are, there- fore, refraining from examining the evidence on record to come to a conclusion one way or the other and we are restricting our consider- ations to the correctness of the two decisions referred to supra."
 14.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : The Constitution Bench approved the view taken by later judgment in Koli Chunilal Savji (supra).   

PRE_NOT_RELIED : In Paragraph No. 5, following has been laid down:- "5.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : The Court also in the aforesaid case relied upon the decision of this Court in Har- jit Kaur v. State of Punjab4 wherein the Mag- istrate in his evidence had stated that he had ascertained from the doctor whether she was in a fit condition to make a statement and ob- tained an endorsement to that effect and merely because an endorsement was made not on the declaration but on the application would not render the dying declaration suspicious in any manner.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : For the reasons already indicated earlier, we have no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that the observations of this Court in Paparambaka Rosamma v. State of A.P.
(1999) 7 SCC 695 (at SCC p. 701, para 8) to the effect that "in the absence of a medical certi- fication that the injured was in a fit state of mind at the time of making the declaration, it would be very much risky to accept the sub- jective satisfaction of a Magistrate who opined that the injured was in a fit state of mind at the time of making a declaration"
 has been too broadly stated and is not the correct enunciation of law.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : It is indeed a hy- pertechnical view that the certification of the doctor was to the effect that the patient is conscious and there was no certification that the patient was in a fit state of mind especially when the Magistrate categorically stated in his evidence indicating the ques- tions he had put to the patient and from the answers elicited was satisfied that the pa- tient was in a fit state of mind whereafter he recorded the dying declaration.

 28           Learned Counsel appearing for the Respondent, placing reliance on the judgment in the matter of Majinder Singh Kang Vs. Commissioner of Incometax, reported in (2012) 344 ITR 358 (Punjab & Haryana), contends that a plain reading of Explanation 3 to Section 147 clearly depicts that the Assessing Officer has power to make additions even on the ground on which reassessment notice might not have been issued during reassessment proceedings, but he arrives at a conclusion that such other income has escaped assessment which comes to his notice during course of proceedings for reassessment under section 148.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : The provision no where postulates or contemplates that it is only when there is some addition on the ground on which reassessment had been initiated, that the Assessing Officer can make additions on any other ground on the basis of which income may have escaped assessment.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : The judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the matter of Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax Vs. Rajesh Zaveri Stock Brokers Pvt.Ltd., (Appeal (civil) No.2830 of 2007, decided on 23.05.2007, is relied upon.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : As regards such statements, a bench of two Judges of this Court after referring to and relying upon the earlier Judgments, observed in Kanhaiyalal v. Union of India1, as under: "45.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : Considering the provisions of Section 67 of the NDPS Act and the views expressed by this Court in Raj Kumar Karwal case2 with which we agree, that an officer vested with the powers of an officer in charge of a police station under Section 53 of the above Act is not a "police officer" within the meaning of Section 25 of the Evidence Act, it is clear that a statement made under Section 67 of the NDPS Act is not the same as a statement made under Section 161 of the 1 (2008) 4 SCC 668 2 (1990) 2 SCC 409 Code, unless made under threat or coercion.

PRE_NOT_RELIED : It is this vital difference, which allows a statement made under Section 67 of the NDPS Act to be used as a confession against the person making it and excludes it from the operation of Sections 24 to 27 of the Evidence Act."

PRE_NOT_RELIED :
