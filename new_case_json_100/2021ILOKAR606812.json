        },
        ". Thereafter, the complainant got issued a legal notice, demanding the cheque amount. But the accused did not meet the demand made in the legal notice, which constrained the complainant to institute a criminal case against him before the Trial Court.",
        "3. As observed above, after contest, the Trial Court held the accused guilty of the offence punishable under Section 138 of the N.I. Act and sentenced him accordingly. Challenging the said judgment, a criminal appeal in Criminal Appeal No.1524/2018 was filed by the accused, which also came to be dismissed, while confirming the judgment of conviction and order on sentence passed by the Trial Court.",
        "4. When this matter is listed today, learned counsels from both side along with the petitioner/ accused and the respondent/complainant as identified by them are physically present in the Court and they file an application I.A.No.2/2021 under Section 147 read with Section 148 of the N.I.

Act, however, subject to the payment of the graded cost by the petitioner/accused.",
        "9. Section 147 of the N.I. Act has made every offence punishable under the N.I. Act as compoundable. As such, there is no bar for the parties in the proceeding to compound the offence. However, at the same time, the guidelines laid down by Hon'ble Apex Court in Damodar S. Prabhu v. Sayed Babalal H reported in AIR 2010 SUPREME COURT 1907 regarding imposing graded cost on litigant also to be borne in mind. According to the said Judgment in Damodar S. Prabhu's Case (supra), if the application for compounding is made before the Sessions Court or High Court in revision or appeal, such compounding is permitted to be allowed on the common condition that the accused pays 15% of the cheque amount by way of cost. Accordingly, taking into consideration the joint application for compounding, the guidelines given by the Hon'ble Apex Court in Damodar S. Prabhu's case (Supra) and the circumstance of the case on hand, I proceed to pass the following:- O R D E R [i] The Joint application - I.A.No.2/2021 filed by both side under Section 147 read with Section 148 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, is allowed; [ii] The parties to the present petition are permitted to compound the offence, however, subject to the petitioner herein (accused) paying a sum of ````45,000/- (Rupees Forty Five Thousand Only) towards graded cost; [iii] Subject to the payment of graded cost, the judgment of conviction and order on sentence dated 13-07-2018, passed by the learned XV Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate at Bangalore City, in C.C.No.27645/2017 is set aside and consequently, the judgment dated 24-11-2020 passed by the LXVII Additional City Civil and Sessions Judge, Bengaluru City (CCH.No.68) in Criminal Appeal No.1524/2018, also stands set aside; [iv] The petitioner herein - Sri.
