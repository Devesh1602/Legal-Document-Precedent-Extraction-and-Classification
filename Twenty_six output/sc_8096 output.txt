Precedent Referred :        a.j. peiris v. state of madras, air 1954 (sc) 616

Precedent Referred : no. 238 of 1985 was registered i.e. state v. kartar singh narang etc. wherein all the accused persons named therein were arrested except one gurdeep singh sehgal who was declared as a proclaimed offender. the accused jagjit singh and gurvinder singh turned approvers and they were granted pardon under section 308 of the code of criminal procedure, 1973. they were examined as p.w. 1 and p.w. 2 in the committal case proceeding in the court of chief metropolitan magistrate on december 24, 1985. both these approvers resiled from their statements in the court of the committing magistrate. the accused persons were committed to the court of sessions to stand their trial for offences under sections 121, 121a, 153, 153a, 302 and 307 i.p.c. and sections 3, 5 and 6 of explosives substances act.

Precedent Referred :  this decision has been considered in emperor v. shandino dhaniparto, air 1940 (sind) 114 wherein it has been held that: "when an accused after accepting pardon denies all knowledge of facts before the committing magistrate and the case is committed to sessions court the pardon cannot be forfeited before the accused is examined in the sessions court. once a pardon is tendered and accepted, s. 337(2) renders it obligatory for the prosecution to examine the approver both in the committing magistrate s court and in the sessions court should the case be committed. failure of the prosecution to examine the approver in the sessions court vitiates the trial."

Precedent Referred :        it has been urged with great vehemence that the appellant, jagjit singh was granted pardon with regard to case f.i.r. no. 238 of 1985 whereas his name appears as an accused in the other four cases which have been directed to be tried along with above case wherein the facts are almost similar. the appellant-approver in such circumstances should not be examined by the prosecution as a witness in as much as his evidence may be used in the other criminal cases wherein he figures as an accused. this is against the protection given by article 2(3) of the constitution of india. it has, therefore, been submitted that the order dated april 27, 1987 passed in revision petition no. 221 of 1986 directing the state not to examine the approver as a witness should not be set aside. this contention is also not tenable in as much as once an accused is granted pardon under section 306 of the code of criminal procedure, he ceases to be an accused and becomes a witness for the prosecution. the only condition imposed by the provisions of the act is that the approver must make a full and true disclosure of the whole of the circumstances within his pg no 1100 knowledge relating to the offence and to every other concerned, whether as principal or abettor, in the commission thereof. so long as the prosecution does not certify that he has failed to do so he continues to be a witness and the prosecution is under obligation to examine him as a witness both in the committing court as well as in the trial court. this has been made very clear by this court in the case of a.j. peiris v. state of madras, air 1954(sc) 616 wherein it has been observed that: ".....we think that the moment the pardon was tendered to the accused he must be presumed to have been discharged whereupon he ceased to be an accused and became a witness."
