Precedent Referred : 291 it 302-303 at and sukh ram v. state of u.p. [1974] 2

Precedent Referred :  even if the number of assailants could have been less them five in the instant case (which, we think, on the facts stated above, was really not possible), we think that the fact that the attacking party was clearly shown to have waited for the buggi to reach near the field of daryao in the early hours of 7.6.1967, shows pre-planning. some of the assailants had sharp edged weapons. they were obviously lying in wait for the buggi to arrive. they surrounded and attacked the occupants shouting that the occupants will be killed. we do not think that more convincing evidence of a pre-concert was necessary. therefore, if we had thought it necessary, we would not have hesitated to apply section 34, i.p.c. also to this case. the principle of vicarious liability does not depend upon the necessity to convict a required number of persons. it depends upon proof of facts, beyond reasonabledoubt which makes such principle applicable. (see: yehwant & anr. v. state of maharashtra;(1) and sukh ram v. state of u.p.)(2). the most general and basic rule, on a question such as the one we are considering, is that there is no uniform, inflexible or invariable rule applicable for arriving at what is really an inference form the totality of facts and circumstances which varies from case to case. we have to examine the elect of findings given in each case on this totality. it is rarely exactly identical with that in another case. other rules are really subsidiary to this basic verity and depend for their correct application of the peculiar facts and circumstances in the context of which they are enunciated.
