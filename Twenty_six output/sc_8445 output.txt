Precedent Referred :          smt. yamunabhai v anantrao shivram adhav and another,

Precedent Referred :          pathumma v. mohammad, [1986] 2 scc 585, followed.

Precedent Relied :  6. we have by our judgment in criminal appeal no. 475 of 1983 (smt. yamunabai v. anantrao shivram adhav and another) delivered today held that the marriage of a hindu woman with a hindu male with a living spouse performed after the coming in force of the hindu marriage act, 1955, is null and void and the woman is not entitled to maintenance under s. 125 of the code. coming to the facts of the present case, it appears that the respondent has satisfactorily proved his case about his earlier marriage with kusumbai by production of good evidence including a certificate issued by the arya samaj in this regard. it is not suggested that rajabai was living when kusumbai was married and was dead by the time the appellant's marriage took place. the position which emerges, therefore, is that either the respondent's first marriage with rajabai was subsisting so as to nullify his second marriage with kusumbai, in which case the appellant's marriage also was rendered null and void on that very ground; or if, on the other 792 hand, the respondent's case of his marriage with rajabai is disbelieved a the marriage of kusumbai will have to be held to be legal and effective so as to lead to the same conclusion of the appellant's marriage being void on either hypothesis the appellant's claim is not covered by s. 125 of the code. she cannot, therefore, be granted any relief in the present preceedings. the decision to that effect of the high court is, r therefore, confirmed.

Precedent Referred :  7. the other findings of the magistrate on the disputed question of fact were recorded after a full consideration of the evidence an should have been left undisturbed in revision. no error of law appears to have been discovered in his judgment and so the revisional courts were not justified in making a reassessment of the evidence and substitute their own views for those of the magistrate. (see pathumma and another v. mahammad, [1986] 2 scc 585). besides holding that the respondent had married the appellant, the magistrate categorically said that the appellant and the respondent lived together as husband and wife for a number of years and the appellant no. 2 maroti was their child. if, as a matter of fact, a marriage although ineffective in the eye of law, took place between the appellant no. 1 and the respondent no. 1, the status of the boy must be held to be of a legitimate son on account of s. 16(1) of the hindu marriage act, 1955, which reads as follows: "16(1). notwithstanding that a marriage is null and void under section 11, any child of such marriage who would have been legitimate if the marriage had been valid, shall be legitimate, whether such child is born before or after the commencement of the marriage laws (amendment) act, 1976 (68 of 1976), and whether or not a decree of nullity is granted in respect of that marriage under this act and whether or not the marriage is held to be void otherwise than on a petition under this act."
