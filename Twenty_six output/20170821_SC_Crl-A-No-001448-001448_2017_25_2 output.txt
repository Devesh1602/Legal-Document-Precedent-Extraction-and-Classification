Precedent Relied :  (h) this court, in prasad shrikant purohit vs. state of maharashtra and another (2015) 7 scc 440, dismissed the criminal appeals filed by the appellant herein while restoring the bail application no. 42 of 2008 to the file of the special judge for passing orders on merits. on the question of applicability of the mcoc act, this court has observed as under:- "95. in the light of our above conclusions on the various submissions, we are convinced that in respect of the appellant in criminal appeal no. 1971 of 2010, namely, a-7, there is no scope even for the limited purpose of section 21(4)(b) to hold that application of mcoca is doubtful. we have held that the said appellant a-7 had every nexus with all the three crimes, namely, parbhani, jalna and malegaon and, therefore, the bar for grant of bail under section 21 would clearly operate against him and there is no scope for granting any bail. insofar as the rest of the appellants are concerned, for the purpose of invoking section 21(4)(b), namely, to consider their claim for bail, it can be held that for the present juncture with the available materials on record, it is not possible to show any nexus of the appellants who have been proceeded against for their involvement in malegaon blast with the two earlier cases, namely, parbhani and jalna. there is considerable doubt about their involvement in parbhani and jalna and, therefore, they are entitled for their bail applications to be considered on merits."
