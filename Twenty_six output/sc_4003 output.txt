Precedent Referred :          c. a. abrham v. income officer, kottayam,

Precedent Referred :          mareddev krishna reddy v. income-tax officer,

Precedent Referred : murarilal v. commissioner of income-tax, central,

Precedent Referred :  this court in a recent judgment-c. a. abraham v. income-tax officer, kottayam (1)-held that the income-tax officer had power under s. 28 of the income-tax act to impose penalty in the course of assessment of a firm even if the firm stood at the date of the order dissolved by the death of one of its partners. in so holding, this court observed that s. 44 of the income-tax act sets up machinery for assessing tax liability of a firm which has discontinued its business and that the expression "assessment" in the different sections ofchapter iv of the income-tax act was not used merely in the sense of computation of income, and when s. 44 declared that the partners or members of the firm shall be jointly and severally liable to assessment, it referred to the liability to computation of income under s.23 as well as the application of the procedure for declaration and imposition of tax liability and the machinery for enforcement thereof.

Precedent Referred :  counsel for the appellants, however, contended that c. a. abraham's case was one of an unregistered firm and the principle of that case has no application where the firm is a registered firm. but s. 44 makes the provisions of chapter iv, so far as may be, applicable to assessment when any business, profession or vocation carried on by a firm has been discontinued : the section declares liability of all discontinued firms and not merely of unregistered firms. there is nothing in s. 44 or the context in which it occur to indicate that it does not apply to registered firms. this court in c. a. abraham's case approved the decision of the andhra pradesh high court in mareddy krishna reddy v. income-tax officer, tenali, (1) which was a case of a registered firm, which was dissolved before imposition of penalty.

Precedent Referred :  the calcutta high court in khushiram murarilal v. commissioner of income-tax, central calcutta (1) was called upon to deal with the submission made before us in this case. in that case the question which fell to be determined was whether imposition of a penalty on a registered firm under s. 28 (1) (b) of the income tax act was justified in law. it was urged in that case on behalf of theassessee-a registered firm-that inasmuch as under, s. 28 (1) (b) a person can be made liable to pay penalty, in addition to the amount of income-tax and super-tax, if any, payable by him in cases falling under cls. (b) and (c), no order for payment of penalty can be against a registered firm, because under the income tax act no tax is made payable by the firm. chief justice chakravartti, speaking for the court, observed, "....................... even when construed by its own language the concluding paragraph of section 28 (1) cannot be said to make it a condition precedent that a person must be liable to pay some income-tax or it may be also super-tax if he is to be made liable for a penalty. clause (b) of the proviso to my mind emphasizes that meaning of the concluding paragraph of section 28 (1) and rests on an assumption that under that provision a person may be chargeable to penalty although he may not be chargeable to tax." the learned chief justice also observed, "......it was not really necessary for clause (d) of the proviso to enact specifically that a registered firm would be liable to pay a penalty despite the fact that it could not be charged and was not, in fact, charged to income-tax or super-tax. the whole argument of dr. sen gupta was that the concluding paragraph of section 28 (1) had left a gap which had been attempted to be filled up by clause (d) of the proviso, but the attempt had not been successful. in my view the gap which undoubtedly existed in the concluding paragraph of section 28 (1) was only an absence of a provision regarding the quantum of the penalty that could be levied from a registered firm because the quantum depends upon the amount of income-tax payable".
