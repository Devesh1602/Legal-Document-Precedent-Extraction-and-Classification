Precedent Referred : fonseca private limited and others v. l. c. gupta & others,

Precedent Relied : the next question is whether the approval should have been formally expressed in the shape of an order. on this question dr. singhvi referred to the decision of this court in fonseca (p) ltd., & ors. v. l. c. gupta & ors. (1) in that case an order made by the deputy secretary to the government of india, ministry of works and housing, who was not empowered to make such an order under the rules of business, was held to be illegal, ineffective and void. we do not think this decision has any relevance. the authority of mr. v. t. dehejia, secretary, ministry of finance (department of revenue and expenditure) to approve the proposal for the central government was never questioned, nor the power of the chairman to distribute the business of the board between himself and the other member with the previous approval of the central government. we have already held that upon the material on record such approval appears to have been given fonseca's case (supra) is hardly of any assistance on the question whether in this case the approval of the central government should have been recorded in a formal order. dr. singhvi characterised the distribution of the business of the board by the chairman as sub delegated legislation and referred to a number of authorities to show that the law required publication of such subdelegated legislation which implied that it must be expressed in aformal document. it was submitted that this was necessary to enable the persons affected by such sub delegated legilsation to ascertain what the legislation was.
