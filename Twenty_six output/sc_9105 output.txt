Precedent Referred :          as regards the power of government to cancel the notification which had been issued earlier, the high court has upheld the power of the government to do so. we think that the 619 high court was right in taking that view. the liability to pay sales tax arose at the point of time when the purchases were made. the power of exemption in the instant case was exercised through a retrospective notification which was a piece of subordinate legislation. it has been held by this court that an authority which has the power to make subordinate legislation cannot make it with retrospective effect unless it is so authorised by the legislature which has conferred that power on it. the law on the above point is neatly summarised in income tax officer v. m.c. ponnoosse & ors. [1970] 1 s.c.r. 678 at pages 681-682 thus : "now it is open to a soverign legislature to enact laws which have retrospective operation. even when the parliament enacts retrospective laws such laws are - in the words of willes, j. in phillips v.

Precedent Referred :                   eyre (40 law j. rep (n.s.) q.b. 28 at p.37) - 'no doubt prima facie of questionable policy and contrary to the general principle that legislation by which the conduct of mankind is to be regulated ought, when introduced for the first time, to deal with future acts, and ought not to change the character of past transactions carried on upon the faith of the then existing law.' the courts will not, therefore, ascribe retrospectivity to new laws affecting rights unless by express words or necessary implication it appears that such was the intention of the legislature. the parliament can delegate its legislative power within the recognised limits. where any rule or regulation is made by the person or authority to whom such powers have been delegated by the legislature it may or may not be possible to make the same so as to give retrospective operation. it will depend on the language employed in the statutory provision which may in express terms or by necessary implication empower the authority concerned to make a rule or regulation with retrospective effect. but where no such language is to be found it has been held by the courts that the person or authority exercising subordinate legislative functions cannot make a rule, regulation or bye- law which can operate with retrospective effect; (see subba rao, j. in dr. indramani pyarelal gupta v. w.r. nathu & others 620 (1963 s.c.r. 721) - the majority not having expressed any different opinion on the point; modi food products ltd. v. commissioner of sales tax u.p.
